## Scene

### Key Scene: A surprised Yui in her brother's room wearing summer pajamas with camera UI

***Narration (Yui)***

My brother gave me a bit of a start. When I opened his door...

#### VFX: Flash

There was sudden flash.

**Caption (Yui)**

W-wha!?

**Caption (Yui's brother)**

That was a good one!

**Caption (Yui)**

Are you making fun of me!?

**Caption (Yui's brother)**

I would never!

**small**: You get enough of that at school...

**Caption (Yui)**

Hmmm...?

**Caption (Yui's brother)**

Is it so wrong that I wanted to take a picture of my adorable little sister?

**Caption (Yui)**

It is if she doesn't know you're going to take her picture!

**Caption (Yui's brother)**

Okay, I'm going to take your picture.

**Caption (Yui)**

Why in my pajamas?

**Caption (Yui's brother)**

I like that shirt.

**Caption (Yui)**

But, its just a shirt...

#### VFX: Flash

**Caption (Yui)**

Geez....

I didn't say you could!

**Caption (Yui's brother)**

Sorry...

You're too cute!

You make the perfect subject.

**Caption (Yui)**

Is this for your school project?

**Caption (Yui's brother)**

N-No, I'd never share *these*.

Do you want to help with my project though?

**Caption (Yui)**

How?

***Narration (Yui)***

I suddenly found myself agreeing to go to the park with my brother.

He said he wanted to just take a few pictures of me just walking and playing.

It was a bit embarrassing, but I didn't mind the attention.

Of course it would take time away from trying to find a new labyrinth...

Or so I thought...

### Yui's house, front, rainy morning

***Narration (Yui)***

Fortunately for me, but not so for my brother, it was raining the next morning.

He moped around in his room for a while, probably hoping the rain would let up, but it really didn't.

In the end I decided to bring him some breakfast.

### Yui's house, upstairs hallway, morning

**Yui, summer casual, smiling**

*-knock- -knock-*

Nii-san!

Are you hungry?

**Yui's brother, off screen**

**small**: Y-Yui?

**Yui, summer casual, smiling**

I'm Yui!

**Yui's brother, off screen**

*-click-*

It's open.

### Key Scene: A surprised Yui gets her picture taking while holding a tray of food

**Caption (Yui)**

H-Hey! N-Nii-san!

**Caption (Yui's Brother)**

Since I can't get pictures of my adorable sister playing at the park, I'll have to take lots here!

**Caption (Yui)**

Why are you so interested in taking my picture all of a sudden!?

**Caption (Yui's Brother)**

Photography!

**Caption (Yui)**

That's what you're doing...

**Caption (Yui's Brother)**

I want to study photography.

I just realized I have the perfect subject...

and I *live* with her!

**Caption (Yui)**

You're scaring me!

### Yui's room, morning

**Yui, summer casual, embarrassed**

Geeez...

What's gotten into him?

Another nightmare?

**Naoko, neutral**

I doubt it.

I think it's just all that time he's spent with you.

He probably just grew close to you.

Besides, you *are* cute.

**Yui, summer casual, blushing**

...

I am?

**Naoko, neutral**

That aside, didn't you have something to do today.

**Yui, summer casual, surprised**

I need to learn more about Seven Hearts!

I wonder what the internet knows...

**Naoko, neutral**

I don't think what we need to know will be online.

**Yui, summer casual, bummed**

You're probably right.

I don't really want to go anywhere while it's raining, but...

### Mizuno Ward Library, raining 

**Yui, summer casual, worn out**

Just when I thought it was clearing up!

#### VFX: Yui senses something

**Yui, summer casual, surprised**

W-What?

**Naoko, neutral**

A labyrinth!

It's close.

**Yui, summer casual, worried**

W-What do I do?

**Naoko, one-tailed, neutral**

Calm down.

You've been through this before.

Find the entrance!

**Yui, summer casual, determined**

Right...

I can sense it!

### Library Labyrinth, ext

**Yui, magical girl, neutral**

That didn't take long...

**Library phantom, angry**

Raaaagh!

**Yui, magical girl, surprised**

Eeep!

**Naoko, one-tailed, attacking**

Come on.

This isn't your first fight.

**Yui, magical girl, attacking**

Right!

**Library phantom, falls**

...

**Yui, magical girl, worried**

Why are there so many out here though?

...

And I don't see a fortress!

**Naoko, one-tailed, attacking**

No fortress doesn't always mean no nightmare.

**Yui, magical girl, attacking**

I can't sense anything either!

**Naoko, one-tailed, attacking**

You're using too much magic fighting.

You'll have to thin out some of the phantoms first.

**Yui, magical girl, worn-out**

There's too many of them!

**Library phantom, falls**

...

**Library phantom 2, falls**

Aaaagh!

#### VFX: flash

**Kotori, magical girl, attacking**

AAAH!!

**Yui, magical girl, surprised**

Another magical girl?

**Naoko, one-tailed, concerned**

This is bad!

**Kotori, magical girl, attacking**

RAAAAH!!!

**Yui, magical girl, hurt**

Aaah!

**Naoko, one-tailed, hurt**

Ouch!

**Naoko, one-tailed, concerned**

Her attacks are just a damaging to us as they are to the phantoms!

We have to withdraw!

**Yui, magical girl, worried**

We can't just leave her here by herself.

**Yui, magical girl, determined**

Hey!

Hey!

We're not your enemy!

**Kotori, magical girl, angry**

W-What!?

**Yui, magical girl, smiling**

I'm Yui

#### VFX: both girls sense something

**Kotori, magical girl, angry**

Nightmare!

#### VFX: Kotori vanishes

**Yui, magical girl, surprised**

Wait!

Don't run!

I can help you!

**Naoko, one-trailed, neutral**

I don't think she hears you.

You should leave the nightmare to her.

**Kotori's kitsune, neutral**

You should listen to her.

Even I know to stay far away when my master fights.

**Yui, magical girl, surprised**

You're that girl's kitsune, aren't you?

**Kotori, magical girl, hurt**

Aaaah!!

**Yui, magical girl, angry**

How can you just stand back and watch?

**Kotori's kitsune, neutral**

Self-preservation...

When she fights she doesn't see anything but her enemies, especially when there's a nightmare.

**Yui, magical girl, worried**

Don't you worry she won't win?

**Kotori's kitsune, neutral**

Every time.

**Kotori, magical girl, hurt**

Aaaaaagh!!!

### Key Scene: An injured Kotori surrounded by phantoms

**Caption (Yui)**

Well, I can't just to nothing while she suffers!

**Caption (Kotori's kitsune)**

I've tried helping.

It never works out!

**Caption (Naoko)**

What will you do?

**Choice, eos**

1. Help the other girl, but try to keep your distance
2. Wait for the girl to fall, then jump in to rescue her
3. Heed the warnings and just leave... she'll be fine!
