### Key Scene: Kotori's kitsune looks down at her as she wakes up in the library

**Caption (Kotori)**

Where am I?

What happened?

**Caption (Kotori's kitsune)**

You're in Mizuno Ward Public Library.

### Mizuno Ward Public Library, upper floor

**Kotori, summer school uniform, confused**

How did I get here?

**Kotori's kitsune, neutral**

You should ask that girl.

**Kotori, summer school uniform, neutral**

Who?

**Yui, summer casual, fidgety**

I'm Yui Sakano, I'm a fifth-grader at Seven Hearts Academy.

I'm also a magical girl.

**Kotori, summer school uniform, angry**

Are you also an idiot?

**Kotori's kitsune, angry**

Kotori!

That girl saved you!

**Kotori, summer school uniform, ashamed**

Sorry, that wasn't very nice.

I'm Kotori Ai, I'm a seventh-grader at Mizuno Middle School.

Most other magical girls know to stay away from me.

**Yui, summer casual, neutral**

Is that because you hurt them?

**Kotori, summer school uniform, blushing**

You figured that out, huh?

I always thought guns were so precise, but I guess that only applies when you actually aim them.

**Yui, summer casual, smiling**

Well, your kitsune *did* tell me to stay away...

**Kotori, summer school uniform, blushing**

Probably because I never can tell what I'm aiming at when I fight.

Everything looks like an enemy.

**Yui, summer casual, smiling**

I didn't mean to blame you.

I chose to fight with you even though your own kitsune warned me not to.

Are you feeling okay now?

**Kotori, summer school uniform, neutral**

I think most of my magic has recovered.

This also happens to me a lot.

**Yui, summer casual, worried**

It doesn't have to.

What if others fought with you?

**Kotori, summer school uniform, neutral**

That'd be great, wouldn't it?

I've tried teaming up with girls in the past, but, well...

You can probably guess how that ends up.

You fought with me.

**Yui, summer casual, neutral**

Yeah...

**Kotori, summer school uniform, defeated**

You don't have to agree so quickly.

**Yui, summer casual, blushing**

Sorry.

**Kotori, summer school uniform, neutral**

No, it's fine.

**Yui, summer casual, worried**

I'm worried about you though.

**Kotori, summer school uniform, neutral**

Well, there's not much you can do, right?

Not without risking your own life.

**Yui, summer casual, blushing**

Um!

C-Can I at least give you my number?

**Kotori, summer school uniform, surprised**

Huh?

**Yui, summer casual, worried**

Y-You could, m-maybe call me if you need help.

**Kotori, summer school uniform, sigh**

Yui, you're either really nice, or really stupid.

Sure I'll take your number.

### Mizuno Ward Library, ext.

**_Narration (Yui)_**

I had never shared my contact information with any one. Both my mother and my brother already knew it.

Kotori had to walk me through how to do it.

I was a little embarrassed.

She shook it off, but I could tell she wondered why a younger girl like me didn't already know how to do it.

After she finally got my number she sent me a text.

**Kotori, off screen, text**

Just so you have my number too (^.~)

**_Narration (Yui)_**

We parted shortly after.

When I looked at her, after talking to her, I had a hard time picturing the girl who fought without a care for her own life, or anyone else's.

She seemed so nice.

### Yui's house, ext., evening

**_Narration (Yui, eoc)_**

I headed home.

In the end I didn't find out anymore about Seven Hearts Academy, but at least I met another magical girl.

Maybe we could be friends...
