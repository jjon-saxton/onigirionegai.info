### Key Scene: Yui is forced to sit on the chair, staining her skirt

***Caption (Yui)***

Not long after transferring to Seven Hearts Academy, it became a horrific torture chamber, one I was forced to go to every day with a smile on my face.

I never understood exactly why, but the other children would always pull pranks on me and tease me.

They seemed to really like it if they could humilate me somehow.

If I acted out, screamed, or did anything at all, the teachers would just end up yelling at me.

Even if the evidence was smeared all over my clothes.

I grew fed up with it all, and things only got worse at home.

### Yui's House, evening

***Caption (Yui)***

One night, after I got home late from school, I found my mother and brother fighting. My brother was fighting because of how my mother had been treating me.

I was just fed up with it and stormed off...

### Key Scene: Yui stands triumphantly as a new magical girl

***Caption (Yui)***

Only to meet a demi-god fox and sign a contract to become a magical girl.

I named the fox Naoko. She told me that, in exchange for the power to fulfill our own desires, magical girls must fight against the nightmares within the world.

I agreed, but I didn't know my mom would be one of them...

### Casino labryinth, main room

***Caption (Yui)***

The one desire in my heart when I became a magical girl was that we would all; my brother, my mother, and I would live as a happy family once again.

When I found out my mom was a nightmare, and that magical girls had to stop nightmares, I looked for away to save my mom.

### Key Scene: Naoko watching mother and daughter hug, with tears in her eyes

***Caption (Yui)***

Fortunately I was able to get her to see that I am still here and so was my brother and that, even with my father gone, she could still go on.

We hugged and my mom was no longer a nightmare.

Naoko seemed surprised that I actually saved a nightmare. It was apparently unheard of.
