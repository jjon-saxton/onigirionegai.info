## Script

### Key Scene: An injured Kotori tries to fight while surrounded by Phantoms

**_Narration (Yui)_**

I listened to the warnings from the girl's kitsune.

I just watched her fight.

She seemed to have the power to conjure old fashioned guns out of nowhere, like how I could conjure Kunai and my sword.

The only problem was that she really didn't seem to aim.

She just fired them and hoped they hit something.

If I had been right up with her, I could easily be hit by her magic.

### Library labyrinth, ext.

**Library Phantom 1, falls**

...

**Library Phantom 2, falls**

...

**_Narration (Yui)_**

I felt terrible just watching as the mysterious girl did her best to fight off so many phantoms.

There was more than one occasion where I still wanted to leap in to help, but, though I could throw my Kunai, I was mostly good up close, and that would be dangerous for me with how the other girl fought.

**Library Phantom 1, falls**

...

**Library Phantom 2, falls**

...

**_Narration (Yui)_**

Even as the phantoms fell one after the other, I still felt bad for just watching.

I kept my distance though.

Even as I could see the girl begin to sweat and have trouble catching her breath.

I just stood back and watched.

**Yui, magical girl, worried**

*(She'll be okay)*

*(She'll be okay)*

#### VFX: Yui senses a nightmare

**_Narration (Yui)_**

I repeated the chant until I sensed a nightmare approaching.

The girl was in no position to fight a nightmare.

Not after using so much magic on just the phantoms.

I had to find the nightmare and get to it before she did!

### Library Labyrinth, main room

**Library Nightmare**

Raaaarrgh!!

**_Narration (Yui)_**

I had to admit, I was far more scared now than when I fought the last nightmare.

Last time I faced a nightmare I had to intention of destroying it.

I wanted to save it.

It really wasn't any different now.

Only, I didn't see how I could.

Could I really destroy a nightmare?

**Naoko, one-tailed, natural**

You don't want to kill this one either, do you?

**Yui, magical girl, worried**

No, not really.

**Naoko, one-tailed, natural**

You have to get rid of it though, and quickly, that other girl will be in real danger if you don't.

**_Narration (Yui)_**

Like my mother, this nightmare was likely a person at some time.

If it was though, there were no clues around this fortress as to who they were.

No way to appeal to its heart.

No way to save it...

**Yui, magical girl, attacking**

Hiyaaah!

**Library Nightmare, hurt**
 
Argh!

**Yui, magical girl, worried**

Sorry, but I have to help the other girl!

### Mizuno Ward Public Library, ext.

**_Narration (Yui)_**

The battle was long, and I was exhausted, but soon the labyrinth disappeared.

I had won!

**Kotori, summer school uniform, passed out**

...

**Yui, summer casual, worried**

Is she?

**Naoko, neutral**

Out cold.

She used a lot of magic, but her heartseed isn't to tainted, and isn't damaged.

She'll recover.

**Yui, summer casual, relieved**

Do we just leave her here?

**Kotori's kitsune, neutral**

I'll watch over her.

**Yui, summer casual, worried**

Still, isn't it dangerous?

**Kotori's kitsune, neutral**

What do you propose?

**Yui, summer casual, neutral**

I'm guessing neither of you can help me carry her into the library?

**Naoko, neutral**

...

**Kotori's kitsune, neutral**

...

**Yui, summer casual, sighing**

*-sigh-*

**Choice, eos**

1. Try to carry her by yourself. (False choice, in the end Kotori always wakes up in the library. No explanation is given about how she got there.)
2. Find someone to help.
