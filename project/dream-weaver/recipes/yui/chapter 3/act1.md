## Scene

### Black void

**Naoko, one-tailed, neutral**

She actually did it.

She actually saved a nightmare.

### Key Scene: Yui asleep in bed, morning

**Caption (Yui's brother)**

Yui!

Yui!

You have to come down stairs, now!

### Yui's bedroom, morning

**Yui, summer pajamas, tired**

Huh, what time is it?

**Naoko, one-tailed, yawning**

Too early.

**Yui, summer pajamas, surprised**

N-Naoko!

What are you doing in that form!?

**small**: Where'd you even sleep?

**Yui's mother (off screen)**

It isn't a big deal.

I just thought, I hadn't made breakfast in awhile...

**Yui's brother (off screen)**

Hurry, or she'll disappear!

**Yui, school girl summer, worried**

Go back to your fox form before someone sees you.

**Yui, school girl summer, determined**

I'm coming!

### Key Scene: Yui's mom making happily attempting to make breakfast in the kitchen

**Caption (Yui's mother)**

Good morning, sweetie.

**Caption (Yui)**

Mom! I think you're burning something!

**Caption (Yui's mother)**

Guess it has been awhile...

**Caption (Yui)**

Why don't I help you?

***Narration (Yui)***

And so, for the first time since daddy died, my mom and I made breakfast together.

I guess the way she had been acting lately was really because of the fact that she was a nightmare at night.

I couldn't be sure, but I knew one thing.

Naoko really did grant me the power to fulfill my own desires!

### Seven Hearts Academy, hallway, morning

***Narration (Yui)***

Of course, that didn't really change anything at school.

**Yui, school girl summer, worn out**

C-come on, j-just give it back.

**Generic 5th grade boy, short-hair, neutral**

I can't believe you actually brought a lunch.

Who made it?

Did you get a boyfriend?

**Generic 5th grade girl, short-hair, neutral**

A boyfriend? Her?

Who'd even want to hang out with her!?

**Generic 5th grade boy, short-hair, neutral**

Yeah, I guess the only one who'd pay her any attention is that lolicon brother of hers!

**Yui, school girl summer, angry**

My brother is not a lolicon!

**Generic 5th grade boy, short-hair, neutral**

You sure?

Come on, show us where he touches you.

**Yui, school girl summer, attacking**

Shut up!

**School guidance counselor, off screen**

What's going on here!?

**Generic 5th grade girl, short-hair, neutral**

Yui went crazy and just attacked a boy!

**Generic 5th grade boy, short-hair, wincing**

Yeah, I was just minding my own business and she punched me!

***Narration (Yui)***

Obviously, that's not what happened at all, but I gave up on trying to defend myself a long time ago.

I just kept quiet and let the two of them spin their lies.

**School guidance counselor, off screen**

My office, now!

### Key Scene: School guidance counselor looks out the blinds as Yui sits behind him

**Caption (School guidance counselor)**

The more questions I asked those two, the more I realized they were lying to me.

So, are you going to tell me what really happened?

**Caption (Yui)**

...

**Caption (School guidance counselor)**

Look, I want to help you, but I can't do that if you don't say anything.

**Caption (Yui)**

...

...

**Caption (School guidance counselor)**

I can't force you to talk, but, if you aren't going to say anything, then I'll have to send you back to class.

**Caption (Yui)**

**small**: O-okay

***Narration (Yui)***

I got up and started to head out of the office.

The man put a hand on my shoulder.

**Caption (School guidance counselor)**

Just so you know, I don't believe what the rest of the faculty says about you.

Even if it were true, I don't think you're a bad kid.

**Caption (Yui)**

I didn't punch him, I slapped him...

and I didn't do it because I'm crazy.

I did it because he called my brother a lolicon.

***Narration (Yui)***

The man lifted his hand, and I left his office.

I didn't much care if he believed me or not.

Chances were, he wouldn't, despite what he said, but I couldn't hide it any more.

### Seven Hearts Academy hallway, afternoon

**Yui, school girl summer, thoughtful**

Do you think there are people here who have become nightmares or phantoms?

**Naoko, neutral**

To be honest, I'd be more surprised if there wasn't any.

Why?

**Yui, school girl summer, shrugging**

No reason...

**Naoko, neutral**

Or you're wondering the same thing I am.

Perhaps school is so bad because of them.

Can't say the thought hasn't crossed my mind.

Maybe you should look into school rumors.

**Yui, school girl summer, worried**

Rumors?

**Naoko, neutral**

You might uncover the conditions for a labyrinth that way.

**Generic 5th grade girl, neutral**

Who are you talking to?

Let me guess, no one will be your friend so you *created* one.

**Yui, school girl summer, angry**

Shut up!

**Generic 5th grade girl, angry**

You know, that new counselor really laid into us earlier...

Seems he didn't believe us when we said you just attacked out of no where.

**Yui, school girl summer, neutral**

**small**: Because I didn't.

**Generic 5th grade girl, neutral**

Don't see how that matters.

Anyway, I just came to warn you.

You better watch your back.

The other teachers still believe everything we say to them.

***Narration (Yui)***

The girl left with just the warning.

I was afraid of what might happen the rest of the day, but I was pretty much left alone.

### Yui's house, evening

***Narration (Yui)***

I have to admit I wasn't too surprised when neither my mom nor my brother were home when I got back.

### Key Scene: Yui's phone, messages

**Narration (Yui's mom)**

I know I haven't been home much, but I'm stuck at work.

Crunch!

Promise I'll be home all day tomorrow.

Tried to make dinner, failed. Left money instead.

### Yui's bedroom

***Narration (Yui)***

The messages on my phone were what really surprised me.

Though I didn't have any from my brother.

Fortunately he showed up just in time to help me order dinner.

We ate in the living room while he played a video game.

Then I took my bath and headed for my room.

**Yui, towel, thinking**

Hmm...

...

Hmmmm...

...

**Naoko, neutral**

What are you thinking about?

**Yui, summer pajamas, surprised**

You were at school today. Remember what happened?

**Naoko, neutral**

Yeah...

You certainly have it rough.

**Yui, summer pajamas, worried**

It's always been hard, I've never fit in, but...

This year's been really hard.

I can't help but think it has something to do with one girl though.

**Naoko, neutral**

Do you think she could be the nightmare?

**Yui, summer pajamas, neutral**

If she is, then I have to find her labyrinth.

Hey! Could it be somewhere outside the school?

**Naoko, neutral**

Well, a nightmare can influence a host outside the labyrinth, so, I'd say it's possible.

This is a big city though...

**Yui's brother, off camera**

Yui, can you come help me with something?

**Yui, summer pajamas, smiling**

I'll be right there!

*(We'll just have to learn more about that girl...)*

### Key Scene: A determined Yui leaves her room

***Narration (Yui, eos)***

I wasn't sure if I was setting myself up for disappointment, or giving myself hope, but...

If there was a way to fix my school life along with my home life than I was going to find it!

I was determined to find it!
