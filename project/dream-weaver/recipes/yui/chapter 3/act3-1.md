### Key Scene: Yui jumps in front of an injured Kotori as she is surrounded by phantoms

**Caption (Kotori)**

Don't get in my way!

**Caption (Yui)**

Hey, I can help!

### Library labyrinth, ext.

**Kotori, magical girl, attacking**

Hiyaaah!

**Library phantom, falls**

...

**Yui, magical girl, hurt**

Hey! Watch where you're aiming!

**Kotori, magical girl, angry**

Just stay out of my line of fire!

Better yet, just leave this labyrinth!

**Yui, magical girl, worried**

B-but, there's too many of them for one girl!

**Kotori, magical girl, attacking**

AAARRGH!

**Library phantom, falls**

...

**Yui, magical girl, hurt**

Ouch!

**Kotori, magical girl, angry**

I can handle them!

**Yui, magical girl, wincing**

What if you can't?

**Kotori, magical girl, enraged**

Just get out of here!

If I don't kill the nightmare, *then* you can have it!

**Yui, magical girl, worried**

I'm not worried about the nightmare!

### VFX: Kotori and Yui sense a nightmare

**Kotori, magical girl, attacking**

Out of my way!

AAAARRGH!

**Library phantom 1, falls**

...

**Library phantom 2, falls**

...

**Yui, magical girl, hurt**

Aaah!

**Yui, magical girl, wincing**

Look, I have an idea.

I can stay here and take out the phantoms.

*You* go for the nightmare!

**Kotori, magical girl, angry**

Why should I?

**Yui, magical girl, angry**

You want to take it out, right?

This is the fastest way!

**Kotori, magical girl, disappears**

Fine, don't die.

**Naoko, one-tailed, neutral**

You sure you can handle this?

**Yui, magical girl, worried**

No...

I only have to hold out until she defeats the nightmare, right?

**Naoko, one-tailed, neutral**

Yeah, the phantoms will disperse when the nightmare is defeated.

**Yui, magical girl, determined**

Then I'll be fine!

**Yui, magical girl, attacking**

Hiiyah!

### Mizuno Ward Library, ext.

**_Narration (Yui)_**

I'm not sure how long I had to fight.

The phantoms seemed endless and there weren't many places for me to use my skills.

I just sliced through them with my short-sword.

Eventually they started to thin out and the labyrinth disappeared.

I don't know why, but I was surprised when I saw the other girl laying on the ground not too far from where I had been fighting.

**Yui, summer casual, worn-out**

Huh?

**Kotori's kitsune, neutral**

She used all her magic.

**Yui, summer casual, worn-out**

Will she be okay?

**Naoko, neutral**

A girl's magic will eventually return so long as they don't lose hope in their desire.

**Kotori's kitsune, neutral**

That said, she'll be vulnerable until her magic is replenished.

**Yui, summer casual, worried**

Then, we can't just leave her here...

**Naoko, neutral**

How far do you think you can carry her?

**Yui, summer casual, thinking**

She's older than me, isn't she?

Maybe I can carry her into the library, but I'm not sure.

**Naoko, neutral**

Will you try?

**Kotori's kitsune, neutral**

It'd be a big help.

**Choice, eos**

1. Hoist the older girl unto your back (false choice, Kotori will always wake up in the library, no explanation is given as to how she got there)
2. Try to find someone else to help
