<h2 id="toc_1">Scene</h2>

<h3 id="toc_2">Yui&#39;s House, front, morning</h3>

<p><strong>Caption (Yui&#39;s brother)</strong></p>

<h3 id="toc_3">Key Scene: Yui asleep in bed</h3>

<p><strong>Caption (Yui&#39;s brother)</strong></p>

<p>...</p>

<p>You should get up before mom...</p>

<p><strong>Caption (Yui&#39;s mother)</strong></p>

<p>YUI!! Get your butt out of bed!</p>

<p>I&#39;M NOT TELLING YOU AGAIN!!</p>

<h3 id="toc_4">Yui&#39;s bedroom, morning</h3>

<p><strong>Yui, pajamas summer, upset</strong></p>

<p><em>-sigh-</em></p>

<p>I guess mom&#39;s home today.</p>

<p><strong><em>Yui&#39;s mom</em></strong></p>

<p>Are you out of bed!?</p>

<p><strong>Yui, pajamas summer, upset</strong></p>

<p>I&#39;m getting dressed!</p>

<p><strong><em>Yui&#39;s mom</em></strong></p>

<p>You&#39;re going to be late.</p>

<h3 id="toc_5">Yui&#39;s house, in-home bar, with bottles</h3>

<p><strong><em>Narration (Yui)</em></strong></p>

<p>By the time I made it downstairs, it was already almost time to leave.</p>

<p><strong><em>Yui&#39;s mom</em></strong></p>

<p>Guess you don&#39;t get breakfast.</p>

<p>Honestly! What am I going to do with you!?</p>

<p>Get your butt out the door!</p>

<p><strong><em>Yui&#39;s brother</em></strong></p>

<p>Don&#39;t worry.</p>

<p><strong><em>Narration (Yui)</em></strong></p>

<p>My brother winked at me.</p>

<p>He handed me my bento.</p>

<p>There was a piece of french toast with some jam on top of it.</p>

<h3 id="toc_6">Seven hearts academy, front gate, morning, spring</h3>

<p><strong><em>Narration (Yui)</em></strong></p>

<p>I had a hard time even talking to my brother as we walked to school.</p>

<p>There was a knot in my stomach the whole time, which made it really hard to say anything.</p>

<p>If he noticed he didn&#39;t mention it.</p>

<p>The knot got tighter the closer we got to the school.</p>

<p><strong>Caption (Yui&#39;s brother)</strong></p>

<p>Guess I&#39;ll see you after school.</p>

<p><strong><em>Narration (Yui)</em></strong></p>

<p>I just nodded and watched as my brother headed toward the high school building.</p>

<p>I took a deep breath.</p>

<p><strong>Yui, school girl summer, hurt</strong></p>

<p>Ouch!</p>

<p><strong>Generic 5th grade girl, pig-tailed</strong></p>

<p>Why are you just standing there? Idiot!</p>

<p><strong>Yui, school girl summer, worried</strong></p>

<p><strong>small:</strong>S-sorry</p>

<h3 id="toc_7">Key Scene: Heart cracks</h3>

<p><strong><em>Narration (Yui)</em></strong></p>

<p>It looked like my day of horror was going to start early today.</p>

<h3 id="toc_8">Seven Hearts Academy, classroom, morning</h3>

<p><strong>Generic 5th grade boy, short-hair</strong></p>

<p>You won&#39;t get away from me!</p>

<p><strong>Generic 5th grade girl, short-hair</strong></p>

<p>Just catch her already!</p>

<p>I&#39;ve got her new home all ready for her!</p>

<p><strong>Generic 5th grade girl, pig-tailed</strong></p>

<p>Hurry up, we&#39;re going to be late!</p>

<p><strong>Yui, school girl summer, neutral</strong></p>

<p><em>-disappears-</em></p>

<p><strong>Generic 5th grade boy, short-hair</strong></p>

<p>Damn it! She&#39;s fast!</p>

<p><strong>Yui, school girl summer, worn-out</strong></p>

<p><em>-huff, huff-</em></p>

<p>I...</p>

<p><em>-huff-</em></p>

<p>Just leave me alone!</p>

<p><strong>Yui, school girl summer, hurt</strong></p>

<p>Eeek!</p>

<p><strong>Generic 5th grade girl, short-hair</strong></p>

<p>Gotcha!</p>

<p><strong>Generic 5th grade girl, pig-tailed</strong></p>

<p>The teacher&#39;s coming!</p>

<p><strong>Generic 5th grade girl, short-hair</strong></p>

<p>Don&#39;t think you got lucky or anything.</p>

<p><strong><em>Teacher</em></strong></p>

<p>Take your seats everyone!</p>

<p>Yui Sakano, I need to see you after class.</p>

<h3 id="toc_9">Key Scene: Heart crack</h3>

<p><strong><em>Caption (Yui)</em></strong></p>

<p>I had a feeling I knew what this was about.</p>

<p>To my teachers, <em>I</em> was the disruption, not the other girls or boys in the class.</p>

<p>Just me.</p>

<h3 id="toc_10">Key Scene: Yui sitting at her desk, looking up</h3>

<p><strong>Caption (Teacher)</strong></p>

<p>When are you going to stop being such a pain!?</p>

<p><strong>Caption (Yui)</strong></p>

<p>I...</p>

<p><strong>Caption (Teacher)</strong></p>

<p>Yukari-chan says you slapped her.</p>

<p><strong><em>Narration (Yui)</em></strong></p>

<p>Is that what she said?</p>

<p>As I recall it, she slapped me, but I guess that doesn&#39;t matter.</p>

<p><strong>Caption (Yui)</strong></p>

<p>I didn&#39;t.</p>

<p><strong>Caption (Teacher)</strong></p>

<p>So, Yukari-chan is a liar?</p>

<p><strong>Caption (Yui)</strong></p>

<p>I didn&#39;t say that.</p>

<p><strong>Caption (Teacher)</strong></p>

<p>You&#39;re going to apologize to Yukari-chan and then you&#39;re staying after classes to help class 5-3 clean up.</p>

<p><strong>Caption (Yui)</strong></p>

<p>I can&#39;t, my mom...</p>

<p><strong>Caption (Teacher)</strong></p>

<p>You&#39;re staying after.</p>

<p>Sort it out!</p>

<h3 id="toc_11">Key Scene: Heart cracks</h3>

<p><strong><em>Narration (Yui)</em></strong></p>

<p>The teacher just left.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t even know why I tried to mention my mom.</p>

<p>I knew if she was home tonight and I showed up late she&#39;d be mad, but it wasn&#39;t likely she&#39;d be home.</p>

<p>I pulled out my cell phone, turn it on, and opened the messagaging app.</p>

<h3 id="toc_12">Key Scene: Yui&#39;s cellphone, message to brother</h3>

<p><strong><em>Message Text</em></strong></p>

<p>If mom&#39;s home, tell her I&#39;m going to be late. They&#39;re making me stay.</p>

<p>Sorry =^^;=</p>

<p><strong><em>Caption (Yui)</em></strong></p>

<p>I was about to put my mom&#39;s e-mail in the &#39;to:&#39; field, but decided to send the message to my brother instead.</p>

<h3 id="toc_13">Seven Hearts Academy, pool, afternoon</h3>

<p><strong><em>Narration (Yui)</em></strong></p>

<p>My school day was just beginning.</p>

<p>Because it was still warm, we had a swimming lesson in the afternoon.</p>

<p>I skipped lunch entirely and managed to get to the girl&#39;s locker room before anyone else.</p>

<p>I was already in my swimsuit, stretching by the pool, before the rest of the girls even showed up.</p>

<p><strong>Generic 5th grade girl, short-hair</strong></p>

<p>We were looking for you.</p>

<p><strong>Yui, school swimsuit, worried</strong></p>

<p>...</p>

<p><strong>Generic 5th grade girl, short-hair</strong></p>

<p>Yukari wanted to talk to you.</p>

<p>She said you have something your supposed to say to her.</p>

<p><strong>Yui, school swimsuit, worried</strong></p>

<p><em>-gulp-</em></p>

<p><em>(Maybe it was best to just get it over with)</em></p>

<p>I-I&#39;m supposed to apologize.</p>

<p><strong>Generic 5th grade girl, short-hair</strong></p>

<p>That&#39;s right, for slapping her.</p>

<p><strong><em>Narration (Yui)</em></strong></p>

<p>The classmate leaned in real close. I could feel her breath on my ear.</p>

<p><strong>Generic 5th grade girl, short-hair</strong></p>

<p><strong>small:</strong>Must suck to have to apologize for slapping the person who slapped you.</p>

<p><strong>Yui, school swimsuit, flushed</strong></p>

<p>...</p>

<p><strong>Generic 5th grade girl, short-hair</strong></p>

<p>Look, there she is now.</p>

<p>You should hurry.</p>

<p><strong><em>Narration (Yui)</em></strong></p>

<p>I stood.</p>

<p>I turned toward the entrance.</p>

<p>I took one step.</p>

<p><strong>Yui, school swimsuit, hurt</strong></p>

<p>Ouch!</p>

<p><strong><em>Narration (Yui)</em></strong></p>

<p>My face hit the concrete next to the pool.</p>

<p>I moved my hands and tried to push myself back up.</p>

<p>Blood dripped from my nose.</p>

<p><strong>Generic 5th grade girl, short-hair</strong></p>

<p>Teacher, Yui fell!</p>

<p>Her nose is bleeding.</p>

<h3 id="toc_14">Key Scene: Heart Cracks</h3>

<p><strong><em>Narration (Yui)</em></strong></p>

<p>I was given a towel and sent to the nurse&#39;s office.</p>

<p>The nurse stuffed my nose with gauze and had me sit on a bed with my head tilted back.</p>

<p>She didn&#39;t say a word.</p>

<p>Minutes later she removed the gauze and had me tilt forward.</p>

<p>The bleeding had stopped so she rubbed my nose a bit.</p>

<h3 id="toc_15">Key Scene: Yui leaves the nurse&#39;s office, a kitsune&#39;s shadow can be seen in the hallway</h3>

<p><strong><em>Narration (Yui)</em></strong></p>

<p>She announced that it wasn&#39;t broken and sent me back to the girl&#39;s locker room.</p>

<p>Fortunately everyone was in class so I was able to get dressed in peace.</p>

<h3 id="toc_16">Key Scene: Yui&#39;s cellphone, message to brother</h3>

<p><strong><em>Message Text (bubbles)</em></strong></p>

<p><strong>Yui</strong></p>

<p>If mom&#39;s home, tell her I&#39;m going to be late. They&#39;re making me stay.</p>

<p>Sorry =^^;=</p>

<p><strong>Oniichan</strong></p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry to hear that. You&#39;re not taking the blame for something you didn&#39;t do again, are you?</p>

<p><strong><em>Caption (Yui)</em></strong></p>

<p>I got a message from my brother just as I was heading back to class. I checked it...</p>

<p>He knew exactly what was going on...</p>

<p><strong>Caption (Student, boy)</strong></p>

<p>Is she texting her boyfriend?</p>

<p><strong>Caption (Student, girl)</strong></p>

<p>That&#39;s Yui, you&#39;re talking about, she doesn&#39;t have a friend, let alone a boyfriend.</p>

<p><strong><em>Caption (Yui)</em></strong></p>

<p>I put my phone away without replying to my brother.</p>

<h3 id="toc_17">Seven Hearts Academy Classroom</h3>

<p><strong><em>Narration (Yui)</em></strong></p>

<p>Apparently by &quot;helping&quot; class 5-3 clean up, meant doing everything myself.</p>

<p>As soon as I showed up the <em>two</em> students originally assigned to the task just left.</p>

<p>I pull out my cell phone.</p>

<h3 id="toc_18">Key Scene: Yui&#39;s cellphone, message to brother</h3>

<p><strong><em>Message Text (bubbles)</em></strong></p>

<p><strong>Yui</strong></p>

<p>If mom&#39;s home, tell her I&#39;m going to be late. They&#39;re making me stay.</p>

<p>Sorry =^^;=</p>

<p><strong>Oniichan</strong></p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry to hear that. You&#39;re not taking the blame for something you didn&#39;t do again, are you?</p>

<p><strong><em>Choice, eos</em></strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Nope, I forgot I was assigned, sorry =^^;=</li>
<li>I&#39;m okay =^.^=b</li>
<li>How did you know? Are you psychic nii-san? =O.o=</li>
</ol>

<p>*This is a false choice, it won&#39;t effect the narrative</p>
