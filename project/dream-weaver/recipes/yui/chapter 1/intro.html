<p>This is the first scene in Yui&#39;s story, it will introduce Yui and her background to the audience.</p>

<h2 id="toc_1">Scene</h2>

<h3 id="toc_2">Seven Hearts Front Gate in spring</h3>

<p><strong><em>Caption (Yui)</em></strong></p>

<p>At first glance Seven Heart Academy looked like a nice enough place, especially in spring. The school had a lot of beautiful cherry trees, and you could see them from just about anywhere. A liked those trees, but the school...</p>

<h3 id="toc_3">Seven Hearts Academy Classroom</h3>

<p><strong>Generic 5th grade girl, pig-tails</strong></p>

<p>She&#39;s here!</p>

<p><strong>Generic 5th grade girl, short-hair</strong></p>

<p>I can&#39;t believe she showed up.</p>

<p><strong><em>Caption (Yui)</em></strong></p>

<p>The school was far from pleasant. I know a lot of kids say that. Not very many kids actually like school, but, for me...
<strong>Generic 5th grade girl, pig-tails</strong></p>

<p>Yeah, after what we did to her yesterday, I figured she&#39;d just stay at home.</p>

<p><strong>Generic 5th grade girl, short-hair</strong></p>

<p>Maybe she <em>likes</em> it!</p>

<p><strong><em>Caption (Yui)</em></strong></p>

<p>For me Seven Hearts Academy was like a torture chamber. One I was forced to go into with a smile almost everyday.</p>

<p><strong><em>Caption (Yui, neutral, school girl summer)</em></strong></p>

<p>My name is Yui Sakano I&#39;m a fifth-grader and one of the most famous schools in the entire country, Seven Hearts Academy.</p>

<p>Ever since I was really little I&#39;ve had a hard time talking with other kids my age. No matter what I said or how I said it I never seemed to really say what I meant to say. So I never made a friends.</p>

<p>This year, my father enrolled me here. He hoped it would be a new start for me. A way for me to have a second-chance at making friends. It wasn&#39;t. . .</p>

<h3 id="toc_4">Seven Hearts Academy Classroom, flashback</h3>

<p><strong>Caption (teacher)</strong></p>

<p>Class, we have a new student. Would you come in and introduce yourself?</p>

<p><strong>Yui (worried, school girl summer)</strong></p>

<p>I&#39;m Y-yui. . . Y-yui S-sakano.</p>

<p>. . .</p>

<p><strong>Generic 5th-grade girl, short hair</strong></p>

<p>What kind of introduction was that?</p>

<p><strong>Generic 5th-grade girl, pig-tailed</strong></p>

<p>Seriously! I can barely hear her! What was her name again!?</p>

<p><strong><em>Caption (Yui)</em></strong></p>

<p>Just by introducing myself, I knew things at this school wouldn&#39;t be any different.</p>

<h3 id="toc_5">Seven Hearts Academy Classroom, flashback</h3>

<p><strong>Generic 5th-grade girl, short hair</strong></p>

<p>Hey Yui-chan, it was Yui, right?</p>

<p><strong>Yui (neutral, school girl uniform, summer)</strong></p>

<p>...</p>

<p><strong>Generic 5th-grade girl, short hair</strong></p>

<p><em>(Did I get her name wrong?)</em></p>

<p>Hello, Yui-chan!? You there!?</p>

<p><strong>Yui (suprised, school girl uniform, summer)</strong></p>

<p>...Huh!? Sorry, were you talking to me?</p>

<p><strong>Generic 5th-grade girl, short hair</strong></p>

<p>You are Yui-chan, right? I mean, your name <em>is</em> Yui, right?</p>

<p><strong>Yui (worried, school girl uniform, summer)</strong></p>

<p>Yui Sakano, did you need something from me?</p>

<p><strong>Generic 5th-grade girl, short hair</strong></p>

<p><em>(What&#39;s with the attitude?)</em></p>

<p>No, I mean, not really. I just wanted to talk.</p>

<p><strong>Yui (neutral, school girl uniform, summer)</strong></p>

<p>(small) Oh. . .</p>

<p>. . .</p>

<p><strong>Generic 5th-grade girl, short hair</strong></p>

<p>...</p>

<p><em>(Does she have a problem with me?)</em></p>

<p><em>(Is it because I needed to make sure I got her name right?)</em></p>

<p><em>(Its not my fault she was so quiet!)</em></p>

<p>...</p>

<p>Do you like Phantasy Quest?</p>

<p><strong>Yui (neutral, school girl uniform, summer)</strong></p>

<p>...</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>I&#39;m not a fan of anime.</p>

<p><strong>Generic 5th-grade girl, short-hair</strong></p>

<p>...</p>

<p>Its an MMO.</p>

<p><strong>Yui (neutral, school girl uniform, summer)</strong></p>

<p>... ... ...</p>

<p>MMO? Like a video game. My brother has a console.</p>

<p><strong><em>Generic 5th-grade girl, short-hair</em></strong></p>

<p>It a PC game...How do you not know that!?</p>

<p><strong>Yui (worried, school girl uniform, summer)</strong></p>

<p>I&#39;m not good with computers.</p>

<p><strong>Generic 5th-grade girl, short-hair</strong></p>

<p>Seriously!? I suppose now you&#39;ll tell me you don&#39;t have a cellphone.</p>

<p><strong>Yui (neutral, school girl uniform, summer)</strong></p>

<p>I can text. Did you want my number?</p>

<p><strong>Generic 5th-grade girl, short hair)</strong></p>

<p>Did you really think <em>that&#39;s</em> where this was going!? I was just trying to talk, you know, be nice. Do you even know what that means!?</p>

<p><strong>Yui (worried, school girl uniform, summer)</strong></p>

<p><em>(Well that was quick)</em></p>

<p>Oh...sorry, I...</p>

<p><strong>Generic 5th-grade girl, short hair)</strong></p>

<p>Don&#39;t bother. I won&#39;t bother you again.</p>

<p><strong>Yui (neutral, school girl uniform, summer)</strong></p>

<p>Oh...okay...didn&#39;t mean to waste your time.</p>

<p><strong>Generic 5th-grade girl, short hair)</strong></p>

<p>*(Seriously!? What <strong>is</strong> this girl&#39;s problem!)*</p>

<h3 id="toc_6">Seven Hearts Academy, front gate, spring</h3>

<p><strong><em>Caption (Yui)</em></strong></p>

<p>I really don&#39;t know what I said, or did. Things always just seemed to spiral down like that any time I opened my mouth.</p>

<h3 id="toc_7">Seven Hearts Academy Classroom</h3>

<p><em>Key Scene: Yui&#39;s chair covered in condements</em></p>

<p><em>Key Scene: Yui is forced to sit on the chair, staining her skirt</em></p>

<p><strong><em>Caption (Yui)</em></strong></p>

<p>Kids could be very cruel. I really didn&#39;t know what I had done to diserve this, but I kind of didn&#39;t really care. At least things were different at home. I mean at least they <em>used</em> to be different at home.</p>

<h3 id="toc_8">Yui&#39;s house, front, evening</h3>

<p><strong><em>Caption (Yui)</em></strong></p>

<p>At home, I had a kind older half-brother, an understanding father, and a mother who always seemed to know just what to say.</p>

<p>Whether I spoke German or Japanese, everyone at home always seemed to know what I meant to say, even if I didn&#39;t use the right words, or the right tone. They could always tell.</p>

<p>At home, I was happy. I didn&#39;t have to worry about what was going to happen. I didn&#39;t have to worry about anything. All father expected was that I help with dinner and dishes. Mother just wanted me to put my own laundry in the machine each Sunday and do my homework each night. My brother just wanted to talk or play games with me.</p>

<p>That&#39;s just how it was until one night when my father didn&#39;t come home. . .</p>

<h3 id="toc_9">Yui&#39;s house, in-home bar filled with empty bottles</h3>

<p><strong><em>Caption (Yui)</em></strong></p>

<p>Not long after I made my failed introduction to my new classmates my father died. Mother didn&#39;t tell me how he died only that he did. We held a memorial service, my brother cried. I never saw him cry before.</p>

<p>Since then, when I got home, mom was still out. When she was home, she wasn&#39;t far from a bottle.</p>

<p>Matt was hit hard too, but he didn&#39;t abandon me. He was still there, still wanting to talk, usually about daddy. When he didn&#39;t want to talk about him, we played games together.</p>

<h3 id="toc_10">Yui&#39;s room</h3>

<p><strong>Yui, neutral, pajamas, summer</strong></p>

<p><em>(School sucked! Matt wasn&#39;t always home when I got home. Mom hardly ever got home before I went to bed. I was lonely.)</em></p>

<p><em>(I wonder what I was, why I was alive. I even wonder if there was any point in living. I never thought about ending my life. Well, not at first anyway...)</em></p>

<h3 id="toc_11">Key Scene: Kitsune shadow watches over Yui while she sleeps</h3>
