<p><strong><em>Narration (Yui)</em></strong></p>

<p>Just as soon as the words left my mouth a sudden chill ran down my back.</p>

<p>I closed my eyes.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>Once I opened them I was not longer where I was.</p>

<p>My room was gone.</p>

<p>The pool was gone.</p>

<p>The entire house was no where to be found!</p>

<p>There was only one thing left.</p>

<p><strong>Yui&#39;s kitsune, neutral</strong></p>

<p><em>no text</em></p>

<p><em>add Yui</em></p>

<p>It&#39;s too soon, I haven&#39;t finished her heartseed!</p>

<p><strong>Yui, school girl summer, panicked</strong></p>

<p>What is it?</p>

<p>What&#39;s happening?</p>

<p><strong>Yui&#39;s kitsune, neutral</strong></p>

<p>...</p>

<p>Someone else in your neighborhood must have had a broken heart.</p>

<p>They&#39;ve transformed.</p>

<p>By the looks of it, they became a nightmare and we were sucked into their labryinth.</p>

<p>Wait! This feeling!</p>

<p><strong>Yui, school girl summer, surprised</strong></p>

<p>Mommy!</p>

<p>She was fighting with my brother!</p>

<p>Could that break someone&#39;s heart?</p>

<p><strong>Yui&#39;s kitsune, neutral</strong></p>

<p>It could, you&#39;re catching on already.</p>

<p>But your heartseed isn&#39;t ready yet!</p>

<p>Its too soon.</p>

<p><strong>Yui, school girl summer, worried</strong></p>

<p>Heartseed?</p>

<p><strong>Yui&#39;s kitsune, neutral</strong></p>

<p>It protects your heart while you fight. As long as nothing happens to your heart you&#39;ll heal from any injury.</p>

<p><strong>Yui, school girl summer, worried</strong></p>

<p>But it isn&#39;t done yet? So...</p>

<p><strong>Yui&#39;s kitsune, neutral</strong></p>

<p>Humans are very fragile. Without a heartseed, you won&#39;t last long.</p>

<p><strong>Yui, school girl summer, panicked</strong></p>

<p>What do I do!?</p>

<p><strong>Yui&#39;s kitsune, neutral</strong></p>

<p>Run!</p>

<p>You have to find away out of the labryinth!</p>

<p><strong>Yui, school girl summer, worried</strong></p>

<p>But mommy&#39;s here! I...</p>

<p><strong>Yui&#39;s kitsune, neutral</strong></p>

<p>You can&#39;t save her if your dead!</p>

<p>Look I can protect you for a little while, but I&#39;m no match for a nightmare, even one that just hatched, so...</p>

<p><strong>Yui, school girl summer, defeated</strong></p>

<p>I have to run.</p>

<p>I&#39;m coming back for her though!</p>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t dream of stopping you.</p>

<p>But only after you have your heartseed!</p>

<h3 id="toc_7">Casino labryinth, ext</h3>

<p><strong>Yui, school girl summer, surprised</strong></p>

<p>Who are you?</p>

<p><strong>Yui&#39;s kitsune, one-tailed, smiling</strong></p>

<p>I&#39;m the kitsune you were talking to.</p>

<p>I can use more magic in this form!</p>

<p>Now, come on, we have to hurry!</p>

<p><strong>Generic phantom</strong></p>

<p>Raarraagh!</p>

<p><strong>Yui, school girl summer, surprised</strong></p>

<p>Eeep!</p>

<p><strong>Yui&#39;s kitsune, one-tailed, neutral</strong></p>

<p>Not that way!</p>

<p><strong>Generic phantom</strong></p>

<p>AAAAAGH!</p>

<p><strong>Yui&#39;s kitsune, one-tailed, attacking</strong></p>

<p>Take that!</p>

<p><strong>Generic phantom, hurt</strong></p>

<p>Aaaagh</p>

<p><strong>Yui&#39;s kitsune, one-tailed, neutral</strong></p>

<p>I can sense the exit!</p>

<p><strong>Yui, school girl summer, worn out</strong></p>

<p><em>-huff- -huff- -puff-</em></p>

<p><em>-cough-</em></p>

<p><strong>Yui&#39;s kitsune, neutral</strong></p>

<p>That was too close.</p>

<p>Normally a heartseed grows in seconds, but, they won&#39;t grow in a labryinth.</p>

<p><strong>Yui, school girl summer, worn out</strong></p>

<p><em>-huff- -puff- -weeze-</em></p>

<p>I need to save mommy!</p>

<p><strong>Yui&#39;s kitsune, neutral</strong></p>

<p>Right, just let me catch my breath and I&#39;ll get your heartseed done in a jiffy.</p>

<p><strong>Yui, school girl summer, neutral</strong></p>

<p>W-wait!</p>

<p>What should I call you?</p>

<p><strong>Yui&#39;s kitsune, neutral</strong></p>

<p>What?</p>

<p><strong>Yui, school girl summer, smiling</strong></p>

<p>We&#39;re forming a contract, right? Don&#39;t you think I should know who I&#39;m forming a contract with?</p>

<p><strong>Yui&#39;s kitsune, neautral</strong></p>

<p>T-that doesn&#39;t matter.</p>

<p><strong>Yui, school girl summer, smiling</strong></p>

<p>It does for me!</p>

<p><strong>Yui&#39;s kitsune, neutral</strong></p>

<p>Call me whatever you want.</p>

<p><strong>Yui, school girl summer, smiling and blushing</strong></p>

<p>At my old school we had a bunny named Naoko.</p>

<p>What do you think? Do you like Naoko?</p>

<p><strong>Naoko, blushing</strong></p>

<p>Whatever! Its fine.</p>

<p>Now can I make you a heartseed or not?</p>

<p><strong>Yui, school girl summer, beaming</strong></p>

<p>Go ahead, Naoko-chan!</p>

<h3 id="toc_9">Dark void</h3>

<p><strong><em>Narration (Yui)</em></strong></p>

<p>I couldn&#39;t remember the last time I had smiled like that. I think it was before my father died.</p>

<p>A warmth filled my whole body.</p>

<p>It got so hot I thought it would burn me alive.</p>

<p>A closed my eyes.</p>

<p>Despite the pain, I knew Naoko wouldn&#39;t let me die.</p>

<p>I had complete trust in her.</p>

<h3 id="toc_10">Yui&#39;s heartseed, pure</h3>

<p><strong><em>Narration (Yui)</em></strong></p>

<p>When I opened my eyes a heart-shaped object floated right in front of my face.</p>

<p>Was this the heartseed Naoko had talked about?</p>

<p><strong>Caption (Naoko)</strong></p>

<p>That&#39;s your heartseed. The glowing thing inside is your heart. As long as it shines you&#39;ll have nothing to fear.</p>

<p>Now, embrace your power!</p>

<p><strong><em>Narration (Yui)</em></strong></p>

<p>I grabbed the heartseed and held it close.</p>

<p>Something amazing happened after that. I could feel the same warmth I felt just a few moments ago, but this time not so painfully intense.</p>

<p>The heartseed pushed itself into my chest and I transformed.</p>
