Scene

### Casino labryinth, ext

***Narration (Yui)***

Just as soon as the words left my mouth a sudden chill ran down my back.

I closed my eyes.

...

Once I opened them I was not longer where I was.

My room was gone.

The pool was gone.

The entire house was no where to be found!

There was only one thing left.

**Yui's kitsune, neutral**

*no text*

*add Yui*

It's too soon, I haven't finished her heartseed!

**Yui, school girl summer, panicked**

What is it?

What's happening?

**Yui's kitsune, neutral**

...

Someone else in your neighborhood must have had a broken heart.

They've transformed.

By the looks of it, they became a nightmare and we were sucked into their labryinth.

Wait! This feeling!

**Yui, school girl summer, surprised**

Mommy!

She was fighting with my brother!

Could that break someone's heart?

**Yui's kitsune, neutral**

It could, you're catching on already.

But your heartseed isn't ready yet!

Its too soon.

**Yui, school girl summer, worried**

Heartseed?

**Yui's kitsune, neutral**

It protects your heart while you fight. As long as nothing happens to your heart you'll heal from any injury.

**Yui, school girl summer, worried**

But it isn't done yet? So...

**Yui's kitsune, neutral**

Humans are very fragile. Without a heartseed, you won't last long.

**Yui, school girl summer, panicked**

What do I do!?

**Yui's kitsune, neutral**

Run!

You have to find away out of the labryinth!

**Yui, school girl summer, worried**

But mommy's here! I...

**Yui's kitsune, neutral**

You can't save her if your dead!

Look I can protect you for a little while, but I'm no match for a nightmare, even one that just hatched, so...

**Yui, school girl summer, defeated**

I have to run.

I'm coming back for her though!

### Key Scene: Yui's kitsune, in one-tailed form, looks over her shoulder at Yui

**Caption (Yui's kitsune)**

I wouldn't dream of stopping you.

But only after you have your heartseed!

### Casino labryinth, ext

**Yui, school girl summer, surprised**

Who are you?

**Yui's kitsune, one-tailed, smiling**

I'm the kitsune you were talking to.

I can use more magic in this form!

Now, come on, we have to hurry!

**Generic phantom**

Raarraagh!

**Yui, school girl summer, surprised**

Eeep!

**Yui's kitsune, one-tailed, neutral**

Not that way!

**Generic phantom**

AAAAAGH!

**Yui's kitsune, one-tailed, attacking**

Take that!

**Generic phantom, hurt**

Aaaagh

**Yui's kitsune, one-tailed, neutral**

I can sense the exit!

### Mizuno ward, neighborhood park, night

**Yui, school girl summer, worn out**

*-huff- -huff- -puff-*

*-cough-*

**Yui's kitsune, neutral**

That was too close.

Normally a heartseed grows in seconds, but, they won't grow in a labryinth.

**Yui, school girl summer, worn out**

*-huff- -puff- -weeze-*

I need to save mommy!

**Yui's kitsune, neutral**

Right, just let me catch my breath and I'll get your heartseed done in a jiffy.

**Yui, school girl summer, neutral**

W-wait!

What should I call you?

**Yui's kitsune, neutral**

What?

**Yui, school girl summer, smiling**

We're forming a contract, right? Don't you think I should know who I'm forming a contract with?

**Yui's kitsune, neautral**

T-that doesn't matter.

**Yui, school girl summer, smiling**

It does for me!

**Yui's kitsune, neutral**

Call me whatever you want.

**Yui, school girl summer, smiling and blushing**

At my old school we had a bunny named Naoko.

What do you think? Do you like Naoko?

**Naoko, blushing**

Whatever! Its fine.

Now can I make you a heartseed or not?

**Yui, school girl summer, beaming**

Go ahead, Naoko-chan!

### Dark void

***Narration (Yui)***

I couldn't remember the last time I had smiled like that. I think it was before my father died.

A warmth filled my whole body.

It got so hot I thought it would burn me alive.

A closed my eyes.

Despite the pain, I knew Naoko wouldn't let me die.

I had complete trust in her.

### Yui's heartseed, pure

***Narration (Yui)***

When I opened my eyes a heart-shaped object floated right in front of my face.

Was this the heartseed Naoko had talked about?

**Caption (Naoko)**

That's your heartseed. The glowing thing inside is your heart. As long as it shines you'll have nothing to fear.

Now, embrace your power!

***Narration (Yui)***

I grabbed the heartseed and held it close.

Something amazing happened after that. I could feel the same warmth I felt just a few moments ago, but this time not so painfully intense.

The heartseed pushed itself into my chest and I transformed.

### Key Scene: Yui stands triumphantly as a new magical girl

***Caption (Yui), eoc***

I became a magical girl!
