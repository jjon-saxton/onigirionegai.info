Scene

### Seven Hearts Front Gate in spring

***Caption (Yui)***

Not long after transferring to Seven Hearts Academy, it became a horrific torture chamber, one I was forced to go to every day with a smile on my face.

### Key Scene: Yui's chair covered in condements

***Caption (Yui)***

I never understood exactly why, but the other children would always pull pranks on me and tease me.

They seemed to really like it if they could humilate me somehow.

If I acted out, screamed, or did anything at all, the teachers would just end up yelling at me.

Even if the evidence was smeared all over my clothes.

### Key Scene: Kitsune shadow watches over Yui while she sleeps

***Caption (Yui)***

My pillow was usually soaked with tears by the time I got to sleep.

Little did I know that something, other than my brother, was looking out for me.

### Seven Hearts Academy, pool, afternoon

***Caption (Yui)***

During a particularly hard day, after I was tripped by the pool and sent to the nurse's office with a bloody nose...

### Yui's house, front, evening

***Caption (Yui)***

I came home to find my brother and my mother fighting.

To my brother's credit, he was fighting over how my mother had been treating me since daddy died.

I didn't like it!

I ended up storming away from them.

It was probably the best decision I made all day. Maybe even in my short eleven years.

### Key Scene: Yui's kitsune, in one-tailed form, looks over her shoulder at Yui

***Caption (Yui)***

You see I met a strange creature that called itself a demigod fox. It offered me a contract.

After some thought I accepted and became I magical girl with the hope that I might be able to get my mom back!

### Key Scene: Yui stands triumphantly as a new magical girl
