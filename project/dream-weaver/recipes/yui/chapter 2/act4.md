Scene

### Key Scene: Yui, in her magical girl form, stands in her brother's room

***Narration (Yui)***

I was very releaved when I discovered that I realized I was no longer standing in a creepy hallway, but in my brother's room.

So releaved that I soon realized just how tired I was.

My eyes started to droop.

### Black void

***Narration (Yui)***

Before I knew it I had fallen asleep.

### Key Scene: Yui asleep in a corner of her brother's room

**Caption (Yui's brother)**

**small:**Yui...

Yui...

***Narration (Yui)***

I heard a voice.

Someone was gently shaking me.

**Caption (Yui's brother)**

Yui!

### Key Scene: Yui rubs her eye as she wakes up in the corner of her brother's room

**Caption (Yui)**

Nii-san.

**Caption (Yui's brother)**

Welcome back.

**Caption (Yui)**

Where's mom!?

**Caption (Yui's brother)**

Mom!?

She stormed out after our fight.

I haven't seen her since.

**Caption (Yui)**

Oh.

**Caption (Yui's brother)**

Come on, we still have school.

I'm guessing that's the uniform you wore yesterday.

Why don't you take a quick bath and change into a fresh uniform?

***Narration (Yui)***

I suddenly remembered the labryinth just as my brother reached for the door handle.

I wasn't sure if he was safe because his room was the safe room, or what, but I didn't want him to get sucked in.

I was going to call out to him, but he opened the door.

It wasn't the fortress hallway, but just our usual normal one.

**Caption (Yui's brother)**

Or I could call the school and tell them you're not feeling well.

It'd be better if mom called, but I could just say she's at work.

***Caption (Yui)***

I was confused, but then remembered Naoko said something like some labryinths are only active during certain times.

Speaking of Naoko, I didn't see her!

I looked around.

My brother must have thought I was shaking my head.

**Caption (Yui's brother)**

You *want* to go to school!

**Caption (Yui)**

Huh!?

**Caption (Yui's brother)**

Better hop in the bath than.

I'll put a fresh uniform on the door and make you something to eat.

You didn't have anything last night.

### Yui's house, bath, morning

**Naoko, neutral**

I hope I didn't make you worry.

I had to keep a low profile because of your brother.

**Yui, nude/towel, neutral**

Is the labryinth gone?

**Naoko, neutral**

No, just inactive.

It'll probably come back tonight.

Are you okay?

**Yui, nude/towel, tearing up**

Mommy's not home!

What if she is the nightmare!?

Will I have to kill her!?

**Naoko, neutral**

Know one thing, Yui. I'll never lie to you.

It is possible you'll have to kill your mother if she is the nightmare.

**Yui, nude/towel, crying**

But I wanted this power so I could get her back, not kill her!

### Key Scene: Naoko, in one-tailed form, hugs Yui in the bath

**Caption (Naoko)**

Then you'll have to believe there is another way, and that you'll find it.

**Caption (Yui's brother)**

Your breakfast is ready, hurry up and get dressed.

### Seven Hearts Academy, front gate, spring, morning

***Narration (Yui)***

I watched the water drain from the tub got out at changed into a the fresh uniform my brother left for me.

He made instant miso soup and warmed up some left over rice.

It wasn't much, but it was breakfast.

I ate it quickly.

As I walked to school I kicked myself for even hinting to him that I actually *wanted* to be here.

### Seven Hearts Academy, entrance, morning

***Unknown girl A***

Ssssh...

There she is.

***Unknown girl B***

*-laugh-*

I heard she got a nosebleed during swimming class.

***Unknown girl A***

Huh?

**Generic 5th grade girl, short-hair**

Haha

Everyone's talking about you.

**Yui, school girl summer, blushing and tearing up**

I-I...

**Generic 5th grade girl, short-hair**

*I-I...*

You're so pathetic!

Look at you!

Are you seriously about to cry!?

The day's just starting.

**Hikari, school girl summer, defiant**

Hey!

I think you're the pathetic one.

Picking on a classmate like that.

What did she do to you?

**Generic 5th grade girl, short-hair**

What do you know?

#### BG FX, magical sensing something

**Yui, school girl summer, neutral**

*(What!?)*

**Hikari, school girl summer, smiling**

I'm Hikari Minamoto. I'm in class 6-2.

**Yui, school girl summer, neutral**

Y-Yui Sakano...

But you really shouldn't have done that.

**Hikari, school girl summer, smiling**

Don't worry about it.

That girl was being mean.

I couldn't stand it.

**Yui, school girl summer, worried**

I worry about it.

She'll be back tomorrow, and she'll be mad.

**Hikari, school girl summer, neutral**

You have it rough, huh?

***Caption***

*-riiiiing- -riiing-*

**Hikari, school girl summer, smiling**

See you around.

***Narration (Yui)***

The girl left, but that wasn't the last surprise I would get that morning...

**Naoko, neutral**

Did you pick up a protector?

Here I was all worried about you too.

**Yui, school girl summer, surprised**

H-how did you get here!?

**Naoko, neutral**

You better get to class.

### Seven Hearts Academy, gym, afternoon

***Narration (Yui)***

I didn't see the other girl again all day, and my tormentors seemed to steer clear of me.

Which was probably a good things, because Naoko was here and I didn't want her doing anything strange.

Instead of swimming class today we had a regular gym class. I put on my gym clothes, but got dizzy all of a sudden and was told to sit and watch.

I decided it would be a great time to ask Naoko something.

**Yui, school girl gym, thinking**

Can magical girls sense other magical girls?

**Naoko, neutral**

Magical girl sense magic.

Sometimes that's from a higher level phantom or a nightmare, but, yeah, it can also be from a magical girl.

**Yui, school girl gym, thinking**

So there are others?

**Naoko, neutral**

Magical girls?

Sure, plenty.

Magical girls can also sense labryinths.

**Yui, school girl gym, surprised**

Do you think there could be a labryinth here, at my school!?

**Naoko, neutral**

To me, its more plausable than some random girl you just happened to meet today being a magical girl.

**Yui, school girl gym, worried**

But, I never got sucked into a labryinth until last night...

**Naoko, neutral**

The nightmare here could be dorment or there could be special conditions needed to enter the labryinth.

**Yui, school girl gym, inqusitive**

Special conditions?

Like a specific time of day?

**Naoko, neutral**

I did mentioned something about that yesterday...

But time of day isn't the only condition.

Sometimes a ritual needs to be performed.

Rituals aren't always formal.

Its really just a set of actions someone needs to take.

**Yui, school girl gym, neutral**

Why would a nightmare do that?

**Naoko, neutral**

Not sure, maybe they only have taste for certain people, or maybe it isn't their doing, but some sort of seal placed on the labryinth by something else.

Either way, if you want to get in, you'd need to find the conditions and meet them.

Being that your job is to defeat nightmares, its something you'd have to learn eventually.

**Yui, school girl gym, neutral**

But, if there are other magical girls...

**Naoko, neutral**

Why not work together?

I hear some girls form teams, but It doesn't always work out.

**Yui, school girl gym, surprised**

Why not!?

**Naoko, neutral**

Each magical girl has their own desires, there own reason for fighting.

If a magical girl wants to survive they can't let *anything* stand in their way, even a friend.

**Yui, school girl gym, worried**

I see.

**Naoko, neutral**

Don't worry about it, you have me!

**Yui, school girl gym, worried**

Yeah...

### Casino Labryinth, ext

***Narration (Yui), eos***

All-in-all, the rest of the day was pretty boring.

I soon found myself on the way home.

I had to stay after class again, but I was out a little earlier than before.

Not that it mattered, because the labryinth had returned...
