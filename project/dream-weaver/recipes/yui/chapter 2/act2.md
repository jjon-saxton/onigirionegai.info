### Key Scene: A phantom gazes down on the pair from a perch near the hole in the wall

***Narration (Yui)***

Just as I was about to yanked one of my kunai out to plunge in just below the hole in the wall I saw something peer at us from above.

I froze in fear.

The creature gazed down at me. It was so close I could smell its horrable breath.

My hands began to shake...

I thought I might lose my grip on the handles of my kunai.

Just as I was about to scream. The creature shifted and turned away from me.

I breathed a sigh of relief.

### Bar Labryinth, fortress wall ledge

**Yui, magical girl, releaved**

I thought it was looking right at me.

**Naoko, neutral**

It didn't seem to see you.

***Caption (Yui)***

Two more motions and I was safe on the ledge near an opening in the wall.

**Yui, magical girl, neutral**

What was that thing?

**Naoko, neutral**

We call the phantoms.

People who lost their way or never found their place in society are drawn to nightmares.

They take on forms like that.

Sometimes they lose some of their senses, but it looked right at you.

Maybe you have a special ability.

I suppose stealth would make sense given your form.

**Yui, magical girl, confused**

What are you talking about?

**Naoko, one-tailed, neutral**

Some magical girls have rare talents, things that only a few magical girls have.

Sometimes they can move faster than others, or they have exceptionally strong powers of persuasion.

Either way, it says them apart from other girls.

I think your talents lie in stealth.

You can mask yourself, whether conciously or not, from phantoms.

**Yui, magical girl, thinking**

So, it didn't see me because I didn't *want* it to see me.

**Naoko, one-tailed, neutral**

Something like that.

Now, come on, we need to find your mother, remember?

**Yui, magical girl, determined**

Right!

### Key Scene: Yui sneaks through a vent in the fortress

***Narration (Yui)***

The hole I discovered in the wall led to small crawl space.

It was surrounded by metal and reminded me of scenes I saw in action movies where the hero has to crawl through a vent.

I imagine it would be harder for them.

I was so small it didn't seem at that cramped.

### Bar labryinth, fortress, vent

**Yui, magical girl, focused**

I can still sense her...

I think we're going the right way.

**Naoko, one-tailed, neutral**

I'm just going to follow you.

**Yui, magical girl, worried**

There's a fork...

I think we should go right.

**Naoko, one-tailed, smiling**

I don't know what got into your peers at school, but you're quite dependable aren't you?

**Yui, magical girl, beaming**

Thank you!

**Yui, magical girl, frowning**

But I don't really talk all that well.

I know two languages, German and Japanese, but I can never say what I really want to say in either.

**Naoko, one-tailed, neutral**

So your peers pick on you because of a series of misunderstandings?

Kids really are cruel.

**Yui, magical girl, thinking**

Its okay, I have my brother, and, with any luck, I'll have my mom too.

**Yui, magical girl, cautious**

Hold on!

### Key Scene: Yui's peers out of a vent, there is a nice hallway

**Caption (Naoko)**

What is it?

**Caption (Yui)**

If we keep going through here I'm going to lose her.

**Caption (Naoko)**

So, where do we go?

### Bar labryinth, fortress, vent

**Yui, magical girl, focused**

There's a hallway here.

From what I can tell it'll lead us straight to where mommy is.

**Naoko, one-tailed, worried**

We'd be out in the open.

**Yui, magical girl, focused**

I don't see any phantoms, but, I can't see everything.

**Naoko, one-tailed, neutral**

I'll leave it up to you.

**Choice, eos**

1. Try to find a way around through the vents.
2. Leave the safety of the vents and search the halls.
