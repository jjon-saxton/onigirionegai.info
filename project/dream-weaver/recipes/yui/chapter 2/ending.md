### Casino labryinth, main room

**Yui, magical girl, determined**

I'm not going to fight you.

So, are you going to kill your own daughter?

Do you want to lose me too!?

**Casino Nightmare, angry**

You're nothing but a useless reminder of something I once had.

**Yui, magical girl, smiling**

If that were true, wouldn't you have killed me by now?

### Key Scene: Casino Nightmare's heart pieces begin to gather

**Caption (Yui)**

I know you love me.

I also know that I remind you of daddy.

I can't change that.

*We* can't change that.

I know it hurts.

It hurts me too.

**Caption (Yui's mom)**

I pushed you away.

I called my own daughter useless and worthless.

Truth is, I never believed that.

**Caption (Yui)**

I know.

It hurt, but I know you didn't mean it.

You were drunk and you were hurting.

**Caption (Yui's mom)**

That's no excuse!!

I should have been there for you!

I should have protected you...

embraced you...

told you everything would be just fine.

We'd move on somehow.

But I pushed you away.

You must hate me!

**Caption (Yui)**

I don't hate you.

I wouldn't be here if I hated you.

### Key Scene: Yui embraces the casino nightmare as it begins to tranform back to her mother

**Caption (Yui)**

I want us to live together.

I want us to be happy together...

All of us!

**Caption (Yui's mom)**

I'd like that.

***Narration (Yui)***

I held my mom.

She held me.

The nightmare disappeared and so did the casino.

I found myself sitting on my mom's bed.

We were both crying as we held onto each other.

We didn't want to let go.

I slept there that night.

### Key Scene: Naoko watching mother and daughter hug, with tears in her eyes

***Narration (Naoko, eoc)***

She actually did it.

She actually saved a nightmare.
