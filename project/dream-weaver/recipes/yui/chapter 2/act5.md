Scene

### Casino Labryinth, ext.

***Narration (Yui)***

After a fairly uneventful day at school, I headed home. Only my house wasn't there...

In its place was the casino-like fortress with its high walls that breached yesterday.

**Yui, school girl summer, worried**

The labryinth is back!

**Naoko, one-tailed, neutral**

This nightmare must only be active in the evening.

**Yui, school girl summer, neutral**

Couldn't this just be a condition?

**Naoko, one-tailed, neutral**

Sure, but we don't really sense it during the day.

**Yui, school girl summer, neutral**

I guess that's true.

Am I going to have to climb that again?

***Narration (Yui)***

I looked up at the tall wall again.

I don't remember how long it had taken to scale it the first time, and it didn't seem all that hard, but, for some reason, I was afraid to do it again.

### Key Scene: A phantom gazes down on the pair from a perch near the hole in the wall

***Narration (Yui)***

Maybe it wasn't the climb that I was really worried about...

Maybe it was that more phantoms might be waiting for me at the top.

### Key Scene: Naoko opens a gate in front of the casino fortress wall

**Caption (Naoko)**

We know of one place in your house that isn't swallowed by the labryinth, right?

**Caption (Yui)**

My brother's room!

**Caption (Naoko)**

I can open a gate between here and there.

You just walk in and you'll be in his room.

### Bar labryinth, ext.

**Yui, school girl summer, worried**

What if he sees me?

I mean aren't I just going to appear out of no where, right in his room?

**Naoko, neutral**

I'll go first.

In this form it won't be easy for him to notice me.

If its clear, I'll signal you.

**Yui, school girl summer, neutral**

I suppose that will work.

I'll transform once we go back into the labryinth, just in case.

### Key Scene: Naoko opens a gate in front of the casino fortress wall

***Narration (Yui)***

Naoko stepped through the gate she opened.

I waited just a few moments.

Naoko, back in her human-like form, beckoned.

I stepped through the gate.

### Yui's brother's room

**Yui, school girl summer, neutral**

He really isn't here.

**Naoko, one-tailed, smiling**

Nope!

**Yui, school girl summer, worried**

Does that mean he's trapped in the labryinth?

**Naoko, one-tailed, neutral**

Probably, but he might not realize it.

**Yui, magical girl, determined**

Then I better take care of this nightmare!

**Naoko, one-tailed, neutral**

About that, if its your mom, you wouldn't want to kill her, right?

**Yui, magical girl, worried**

Of course not! I want to live happily with both of them!

**Naoko, one-tailed, neutral**

I've never known of any magical girls who save nightmares, but, if it were possible, you could only do it through restoring her hope.

**Yui, magical girl, thinking**

Restoring her hope?

**Naoko, one-tailed, neutral**

Find out what she really desires and find away to convince her she can still fulfill it!

There should be clues in the labryinth.

If you try to confront her without knowing that, than, even if you win, you might lose.

You could become a nightmare yourself!

### Key Scene: Yui re-enters the casino labyrinth

**Caption (Yui)**

Then I just have to find clues.

I can do that!

### Casino Labryinth, corridor

**Naoko, one-tailed, smiling**

Good girl!

I think you *might* just be the first magical girl to save a nightmare!

***Narration (Yui)***

There were many doors in the halls of the casino.

In fact, there was one right across from the safe room.

I knew that the doors in the labryinth couldn't all lead to actual rooms in our house, their were far too many, but I had a feeling that door still led to my mom's room.

I could still fainly sense the nightmare.

It was far from here, but, if that room was my mom's, than, there might be something there.

### Casino labryinth, main floor

***Narration (Yui)***

I opened the door.

I knew the nightmare wasn't there.

All I could see were rows and rows of slot machines and gambling tables.

I never knew my mom to like gambling, so I began to doubt this was her labryinth, but I noticed something else...

Well two things actually...

*Everyone* held a drink, and there pictures of my dad on every machine.

**Yui, magical girl, tearing up**

Daddy?

Hey, Naoko, my desire is to live happily with everyone, right?

**Naoko, one-tailed, neutral**

You know your desires better than anyone, but that's the one that formed our contract, yes.

**Yui, magical girl, tearing up**

Then mom's, could have something to do with daddy.

**Yui, magical girl, crying**

But he's gone!

If he's gone, than I can't "restore my mom's hope"...

Unless magical girls can bring back the dead!

**Naoko, one-tailed, neutral**

Bringing back the dead, changing the past, living forever, those are all beyond the power of a magical girl.

There are still limits and laws.

**Yui, magical girl, terrified with tears**

I'm going to become a nightmare, aren't I?

I'm going to kill my mom, and I'm going to become a nightmare!

**Yui's mom, off screen**

Yui?

***Narration (Yui)***

I barely heard the familiar voice...

and before I knew it, I held my kunai in my hands, each one resting against a wrist.

**Yui's mom, off screen**

Yui!? What are you doing here!?

***Narration (Yui)***

I heard the voice again, but, more importantly, I sensed the magic I had sensed before.

The magic that I thought was my mom, or the nightmare.

It was enough to make me stop what I was doing.

I got up and turned around, my kunai ready.

### Key scene: Yui confronts her first nightmare

***Narration (Yui)***

Only it wasn't my mom that stood in front of me.

It felt like her.

It sounded like her.

It didn't look like her!

It was frightening.

Worse than any phantom I'd seen so far.

**Caption (Casino Nightmare)**

What are you doing, you worthless girl!?

Have you come to fight me?

Have you come to kill me?

**Caption (Yui)**

You've become such a mean person.

You're hardly ever home.

When you are home, you're drunk, and you always yell at me.

You've called me worthless so many times, I'm actually used to it.

Despite all that, even if I've wanted to be dead myself, I've never wanted to kill you.

### Key Scene: Yui drops her kunai, they begin to disappear

**Caption (Yui)**

Even now, I don't want you dead.

I don't want to fight you.

**Caption (Casino Nightmare)**

So, the girl who can't even save herself, thinks she can save me!

None of you girls have ever saved a nightmare, isn't that right!?

### Casino labryinth, main room

**Yui, magical girl, determined**

I'm going to be the first!

I know we lost daddy, but that doesn't mean we have to lose each other.

**Casino Nightmare, angry**

You stupid, stupid girl!

**Yui, magical girl, hurt**

AAaaah!!

**Naoko, one-tailed, worried**

Yui!

**Yui, magical girl, determined**

I'm not stupid!

I'm your daughter!

I love you!

Daddy may be gone, and there isn't anything anyone can do about that!

I won't lose you, and I'll never leave you!

**Yui, magical girl, hurt**

Aaaaah!

***Choice, eos***

1. Keep trying to talk to the nightmare.
2. Fight back!
