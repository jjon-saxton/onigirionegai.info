Scene

### Bar labryinth, fortress, vent

***Narration (Yui)***

I honestly wasn't sure leaving the vent was very smart.

Being out in the open was certainly a lot scarier, but I could only imagine what would happen if we got lost in the vents.

**Yui, magical girl, determined**

We have to go this way.

If we don't we could wonder the vents forever!

**Naoko, one-tailed, neutral**

As I said, it's up to you.

But, for the record, I think you're right.

**Naoko, neutral**

I'll climb on your back.

That way I can warn you if something tries to get us from behind.

**Yui, magical girl, smiling**

Good idea!

It would be very helpful!

### Key Scene: Yui drops from the vent

***Narration (Yui)***

I had no choice but to get the gratting. It fell to the ground with a loud bang.

If any phantoms were around they'd obviously hear that.

I waited.

...

There seemed to still be no signs of anything in the hallway so I dangled my feet over the edge of the newly created hole.

True to her word, Naoko, climbed onto my back.

I lifted myself up and over the ledge than shifted so I was dangling by my hands.

I took a deep breath...

and let go.

My feet hit the ground, but my knees didn't bunkle.

### Bar labryinth, fortress, hallway

**Naoko, neutral**

No one behind you!

**Phantom, angry**

RAAARAAGH!!

**Phantom (2), angry**

AAAH!?

**Yui, magical girl, surprised**

Two in front!

*(Maybe they had been attracted by the noise, but they seemed more interested in each other than me)*

**Naoko, one-tailed, determined**

I'll help you take 'em out!

**Yui, magical girl, sushing**

Sssssh!

They haven't seen us yet!

***Narration (Yui)***

I grabbed Naoko's arm an pulled her behind the corner of an ajacent hallway.

**Yui, magical girl, neutral**

We have a problem though.

If we don't go that way then we might as well have just stayed in the vent.

**Naoko, one-tailed, neutral**

They're just low-level phantoms, even a young magical girl, like yourself, should have no problem with them.

**Yui, magical girl, thinking**

Sure, if were just the two of them...

maybe even if they called a couple of friends...

but what if there were a lot of them?

**Naoko, one-tailed, neutral**

You'll do just fine.

**Yui, magical girl, worried**

I don't know...

We have no idea what's up ahead...

**Naoko, one-tailed, smiling**

Maybe try to take them out before they notice.

You're a kunoichi, right?

Plus you can mask your presence, right?

**Yui, magical girl, determined**

Right!

I just need to sneak up on them!

Wait here!

### Key Scene: Yui sneaks up and kills two phantoms with kunai

***Caption (Yui)***

With a thought my kunai appeared in my hands again and I looked around the corner an up the hallway.

The two phantoms simply stood there. It didn't look like they were going to move.

I sighed.

Part of me hoped they would just move on, because than I wouldn't have to do what I was about to do.

***Narration (Yui)***

There were several other hallways branching from this one, giving plenty of corners to hide behind.

There were also a few cases an barrels in the hallway.

Like when I watched my brother play a stealth game, I planned a route.

I hoped from corner to crate, crate to barrel, barrel to corner until I was almost right on top of the phantoms.

*-slash-*

One phantom fell to my blade.

*-slash-*

Before the other even knew what was happening, it too fell.

I turned to where I left Naoko and motioned for her to come.

### Bar labryinth, fortress, hallway

**Naoko, one-tailed, proud**

That was impressive.

Like watching a real ninja at work.

**Yui, magical girl, embarrassed**

It wasn't all that.

**Naoko, one-tailed, proud**

I was right to pick you.

With a little work you'll be a mighty fine magical girl.

#### BG FX, magical girl sensing magic

**Yui, magical girl, surprised**

There's something else here.

**Naoko, one-tailed, inquisitive**

Your mom?

**Yui, magical girl, shakes head**

Not her...

Not a phantom.

**Naoko, one-tailed, inquisitive**

The nightmare?

**Yui, magical girl, worried**

I don't think so.

### Bar Labryinth, fortress, safe room door

***Narration (Yui)***

I looked toward the source of whatever I was sensing.

There was a door that wasn't old and decripit like the others and didn't even have so much as one blood stain.

It stood out among all the other doors down the hall way.

In fact, it looked like one of the modern doors in our house.

**Yui, magical girl, worried**

What's that!?

**Naoko, one-tailed, surprised**

It looked like one of the doors in your house.

**Naoko, one-tailed, neutral**

Remember how I said some of the fortresses have safe rooms?

That's probably it.

**Yui, magical girl, worried**

Well, I can't be my room right?

**Naoko, one-tailed, neutral**

It could be your brother's room, or your mother's?

**Yui, magical girl, worried**

Mommy's in here, so I don't think that's her room...

**Naoko, one-tailed, neutral**

Only one way to know for sure.

Like I said safe rooms are safe, so there's nothing to lose by checking.

**Yui, magical girl, determined**

Right!

### Key Scene: Yui, in her magical girl form, stands in her brother's room

***Narration (Yui), eos***

I wrapped a small hand around the door handle, pulled down and pushed the door open.

I found myself standing in my brother's room.

He was fast asleep in his bed.

No idea I was there.

No idea what was going on just outside...
