Scene

### Bar labryinth, fortress, vent

**Yui, magical girl, neutral**

Hmm...

...

We should probably stay in the vent.

As long as I can still sense mommy I should be able to find her.

**Naoko, one-tailed, nodding**

That sounds safer.

### Key Scene: Yui sneaks through a vent in the fortress

***Narration (Yui)***

It certainly sounded safer.

Even I felt more comfortable crawling through the vent than I thought I would sneaking around a hallway.

The phantoms were both disgusting and terrifying.

As we moved a started to loose sense of where mom was.

It wasn't just that we were forced to move away from her several times because the vent just ended or we had to make a turn.

It was like the what I was feeling just started going away.

What's more, I started to feel numb and my eyesight started to get blurry.

The vent had been filled with a metallic, musty smell, but even that seemed to be gone.

My arm slipped and I smacked by chest and shoulder hard against the metal vent.

### Bar labryinth, fortress, vent

**Yui, magical girl, hurt**

OUCH!

**Naoko, one-tailed, worried**

Are you okay?

**Yui, magical girl, ^^;**

Yeah, my arm just got a bit weak.

How long have we been in here?

**Naoko, one-tailed, neutral**

No idea.

**Yui, magical girl, apologetic**

Sorry, but I think we're a tiny bit lost.

**Naoko, one-tailed, worried**

Lost!?

Do you still sense your mom?

**Yui, magical girl, shakes head**

Sorry, I think a lost her a little while ago.

I was trying to find an exit to see if I could pick her up again...

### Black void

***Narration (Yui)***

I suddenly collapsed and everything went dark.

**Caption (Naoko)**

Yui?

Yui!?

YUI!?

### Key Scene: Yui in a hallway surrounded by phantoms

***Caption (Yui)***

When I woke up I saw Naoko trying her best to fend off a group of phantoms.

I'm not sure how, but I wasn't in the vent any more.

Naoko was knocked back toward me.

The sound her body made when it hit the floor was both disturbing and disgusting.

The phantoms quickly turned to me.

***Narration***

Congragulations! You killed Yui!

**Choice, eoc**

1. Try again (returns player to act 2)
2. I hated her anyways! (returns player to character select)
