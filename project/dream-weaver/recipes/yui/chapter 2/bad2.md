Scene

### Casino labryinth, main room

**Yui, magical girl, attacking**

RAAAH!!

***Narration (Yui)***

I didn't want to hurt my mom, but I had a hard time believing she'd want to hurt me either.

I stopped believing that this was my mom, and a began to fight back.

**Casino Nightmare, hurt**

RAAAGH!!

**Casino Nightmare, attacking**

AARRGH!!

***Narration (Yui)***

Naoko watched as I dealt blow after blow. Her face seemed to sink.

My vision turned red.

I could only think of destroying the nightmare that took my mother.

The thought that this *was* my mom, left me all together.

### Yui's heartseed, tainted

***Narration (Yui)***

It wasn't until I had a kunai to the throat of the beast that I realized why Naoko had became so worried.

I glanced down. I had meant to look at my kunai, but, instead I looked at my heartseed.

When it was created it shown very brightly.

Now it was so dim, that I could barely even see it.

### Casino labryinth, main room

**Naoko, one-tailed, worried**

Yui!

**Yui, magical girl, hurt**

Oww!

**Yui, magical girl, afraid**

Naoko...

*(I held out my heartseed)*

What's happening?

**Naoko, one-tailed, worried**

You have to get out of here!

### Yui's heartseed, corrupt

***Narration (Yui)***

Only it was already too late.

My heartseed was already corrupt.

I was so afraid.

Even Naoko seemed to shake.

***Narration***

Yui's fate is unknown!
