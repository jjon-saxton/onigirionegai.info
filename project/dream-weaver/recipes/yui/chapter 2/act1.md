### Yui stands triumphantly as a new magical girl

***Narration (Yui)***

After coming home to find my mother and brother fighting, I got fed up and decided it was time to end everything.

Naoko, a self-proclaimed demigod fox I named, appeared to me and offered me "the power to fulfill [my] desires."

Before that power was granted to me, we ended up in something Naoko called a labryinth. We escaped, and I transformed into a magical girl for the first time.

But now, we had a bit of a small problem...

### Mizuno ward, neighborhood park, night

**Yui, magical girl, surprised**

That labryinth appeared at my house!

**Yui, magical girl, worried**

Does that mean I can't go back?

Where am I going to sleep?

I have school tomorrow!

**Naoko, neutral**

I'm sure you're not really worried about missing school, but I can see how this could be a problem.

**Yui, magical girl, nodding**

Right?

**Naoko, neutral**

Some labryinths have a room or area that's is somehow out of the nightmare's influence.

A type of safe room...

but we have no idea where that would be in relation to your house or rooms in it.

**Yui, magical girl, worried**

And if I go back...

**Naoko, neutral**

You'd probably end up swallowed by the labryinth again.

Though some nightmares are only active during certain times.

**Yui, magical girl, fidgeting**

So what do I do?

**Naoko, neutral**

Well, all we know is your mother is also trapped in the labryinth.

I couldn't really sense the nightmare.

That could be good or bad.

**Yui, magical girl, inqusitive**

What do you mean?

**Naoko, neutral**

It means one of two things, either the nightmare is extremely weak, or...

**Yui, magical girl, surprised**

Really powerful!

**Naoko, neutral**

You catch on quick.

**Yui, magical girl, beaming**

Just something I heard on one of my brother's video games once.

**Naoko, neutral**

Well, it's correct.

The problem is, even I don't know what you can do yet.

If we tried to face a really power nightmare as you are now...

**Yui, magical girl, worried**

I'd be killed...

But mommy is in there, and I have no where else to go.

**Naoko, one-tailed, smiling**

Well, I don't have much power, but I can help a little.

Do you want to go in?

**Choice**

1. *-nod-*
2. Maybe I could just sleep here...

*this is a false choice. Option 1 merely skips the below dialog from Naoko, while option 2 shows it.

**Naoko, one-tailed, miffed (shown only if option 2 is selected above)**

I don't think that's a good idea. The labryinth *could* expand without warning. Besides, you want your mother back, right?

**Yui, magical girl, worried**

*-gulp-*

I'll do my best!

### Key Scene: Yui sneaks around just outside the main labryinth wall with Naoko

**Caption (Yui)**

What is this?

Is there a labryinth in the labryinth?

**Caption (Naoko)**

Kind of.

We call this part the fortress.

Its an area of the labryinth sometimes built up to protect the nightmare.

**Caption (Yui)**

So the nightmare is in there?

**Caption (Naoko)**

They *do* sometimes roam around, but, it more than likely.

Can you sense anything?

### Bar Labryinth, ext

**Yui, magical girl, shaking head**

Hmm...nope

I just sense mommy still.

**Yui, magical girl, surprised**

Wait!

You don't...

Could she...

**Naoko, one-tailed, annoyed**

Anytime you feel like finishing a sentance, just let me know.

**Yui, magical girl, blushing**

S-sorry.

I was just thinking, do *people* become nightmares?

**Naoko, one-tailed, neutral**

You think you mother is the nightmare?

I suppose that's possible.

**Yui, magical girl, worried**

Does that mean I'd have to kill her?

**Naoko, one-tailed, neutral**

Let's focus on *finding* her first.

Do you see a way in?

**Yui, magical girl, focused**

hmmm...

**Yui, magical girl, surprised**

There!

### Key Scene: Small opening near the top of the wall

**Caption (Naoko)**

Up there!?

No where else?

**Caption (Yui)**

That's the only opening I can see.

How can I get up there?

***Narration (Yui)***

I placed a hand on the wall. It wasn't just smooth, it was only slippery and the occassional splatter of blood just made it more slippery.

There was no way I could climb it.

**Caption (Naoko)**

Guessing that giant bow above your butt is just decorative...

### Bar Labryinth, ext

**Yui, magical girl, smiling**

Wait, it might be frilly, but this is a kunoichi's outfit, right?

**Naoko, one-tailed, confused**

You mean like a female ninja?

I guess it has that kind of aethetic.

**Yui, magical girl, smiling**

One of my brother's video games had a kunoichi in it. She could climb walls by stabbing kunai in them.

**Naoko, one-tailed, confused**

Yeah, but, I bet that takes a lot of coordination and strength.

**Yui, magical girl, beaming**

I'm a magical girl now! I bet I'm super strong!

**Naoko, one-tailed, neutral**

Well aren't we just brimming with confedence all of a sudden.

**Yui, magical girl, confedient**

I can to this!

### Key Scene: Yui stabs a kunai into the fortress wall

***Narration (Yui)***

I moved my hands behind my back and suddenly felt a cold handle in each one.

Moving them forward I found I had summoned two kunai.

I jabbed one into the wall.

Despite my confidence I was still surprised when it went in almost all the way up to the hilt.

I pulled on it.

The only way it was coming out was if I yanked it out.

**Caption (Yui)**

I can get you up to, if you go back to your fox form.

**Caption (Naoko)**

I can't protect you in that form.

**Caption (Yui)**

And I can't carry you in *that* form, you're too heavy!

### Bar Labryinth, ext

**Naoko, one tailed, pouting**

Fine!

But you better not get attacked while you're up there.

**Yui, magical girl, smiling**

There isn't anyone here.

I'll be fine!

**Naoko, neutral**

I don't want to lose my first magical girl on her first mission!

### Key Scene: Yui climbs the wall with Naoko on her back

**Caption (Yui)**

It'll be fine.

***Narration (Yui)***

Naoko, in her fox form, climbed onto my back, resting just above the giant bow.

She dug her claws in.

I winced, but bore it.

I pludged the other kunai into the wall just above the first, than yanked that one out and pluged it in just above the second.

I alternated like that, letting my feet dangle as I scaled the wall.

It was very tiring.

I was glad I didn't have to go all the way up.

### Key Scene: A phantom gazes down on the pair from a perch near the hole in the wall

***Narration (Yui), eos***

Just as I was about to yanked one of my kunai out to plunge in just below the hole in the wall I saw something peer at us from above.

I froze in fear.
