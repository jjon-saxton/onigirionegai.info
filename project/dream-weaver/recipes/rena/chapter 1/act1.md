### Key Scene: Reina walking away, with a white kitsune on her shoulder

***Narration (Rena)***

Never in my life had I ever had to watch my sister walk away from me, until my accident, or dream, or whatever it was.

Since that time I had to watch her walk away almost every day.

### Chuou Middle School, classroom, flashback

**Reina, school girl summer, smiling**

Are you ready to go yet?

**Rena, school girl summer, neutral**

U-um, about that...

**Reina, school girl summer, inquisitive**

What?

**Rena, school girl summer, fidgiting**

Y-you know I don't have many friends, right?

**Reina, school girl summer, inquisitive**

I guess. They just don't get you, you know.

**Rena, school girl summer, neutral**

I know I'm a terrible person, but one of our classmates asked for my help. I didn't say yes, at first, but-

**Reina, school girl summer, neutral**

But, you eventually thought maybe you could make friends?

**Rena, school girl summer, neutral**

I know it's stupid, but, yeah, I agreed, and they want me to help now, after school.

**Reina, school girl summer, smiling**

Then I'll just wait for you.

We can still walk home together.

**Rena, school girl summer, neutral**

I hear they usually get out pretty late, you know the narrow streets get dangerous once people start heading home.

**Reina, school girl summer, smiling**

Then we'll just tendem ride, it'll be fine.

**Rena, school girl summer, mad**

Look, I don't want you getting hurt because of me so just go home without me!

**Reina, school girl summer, smiling**

*-shakes head-*

I'll be fine.

**Rena, school girl summer, mad**

Just go home!

Stop being a brat!

### Key Scene: Rena in the bath, her mouth barely out of the water, blowing bubbles

***Caption (Rena)***

Did I hurt her?

I just didn't want her to get bored. There wouldn't be anything for her to do while she waited.

I'm terrible at saying things like that.

But Reina knows how terrible I am, and she never really cared.

I never really hurt her though.

***Caption***

*-knock- -knock-*

**Caption (Rena's father)**

You okay in there sweetie?

**Caption (Rena)**

I'm fine.

**Caption (Rena's father)**

Your sister still needs to take her bath.

### Ikumi residence, bathroom

**Rena, towel, neutral**

I'm getting out now.

**Rena's father, off screen**

I'll let your sister know.

**Rena, towel, worried**

*(Why didn't she come get me herself?)*

*(This isn't the first time I've kept the bath to myself, but usually Reina would just come and scold me herself.)*

*(Am I so terrible that I'm just not worth it any more?)*

### Rena's bedroom, morning

***Narration (Rena)***

When I woke up the next morning, Reina wasn't in her bed.

Come to think of it, I didn't hear her come in after her bath.

Did I fall asleep before she was done?

### Ikumi residence, kitchen

***Narration (Rena)***

I headed downstairs.

Reina was in the kitchen, sitting at the breakfast bar. Her face was buried in a book. A piece of toast in her other hand.

My sister had the cutest, little quirks.

**Rena, pajamas, smiling**

Good morning!

**Reina, school girl summer, neutral**

Hmm.

**Rena, pajamas, neutral**

*(I guess that was a reply)*

What are you reading?

**Rena's father**

Sweetie, you need to change!

**Rena, pajamas, shocked**

Is that the time!? I slept that late!?

Why didn't you wake me up!?

**Reina, school girl summer, neutral**

Not my job.

**Rena, pajamas, neutral**

*(She's definitely mad at me)*

### Chuou Middle School, morning ext.

***Caption (Rena)***

*After I changed, I didn't have time for breakfast. I grabbed a piece of toast and shoved it in my mouth before getting my gear on and shoving off on my bike.*

*Reina had gone without me.*

**Generic sixth grader, long hair**

You two haven't said a word to each other all day. Did something happen?

**Rena, school girl summer, haughty**

Hmph!

**Generic sixth grader, long hair**

So, you're not going to talk about it?

**Rena, school girl summer, neutral**

I...

...

**Rena, school girl summer, haughty**

W-why would I talk about my problems with someone I barely know!?

**Generic sixth grader, long hair**

Don't be like that. You helped us out remember? We spent a whole afternoon together.

**Rena, school girl summer, angry**

So, because we spent one stupid afternoon together, you think you know me!?

**Generic sixth grader, long hair**

I know enough to know there's something going on between you and your sister!

I'm not going to beg for you to let me help you though!

When you get over yourself, I'll...

**Rena, school girl summer, tearing up**

W-wait.

**Generic sixth grader, long hair**

There's the real Rena. Now are you going to tell me what's wrong?

**Rena, school girl summer, tearing up**

D-do you want a snack?

**Generic sixth grader, long hair**

Don't want to appear vulnerable to the others?

You're such a tsundere.

Sure, I'll go get a snack with you, but you have to tell me what's bothering you.

**Rena, school girl summer, blushing with tears**
