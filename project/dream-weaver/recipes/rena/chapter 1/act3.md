### Key Scene: Kistune sillouette watching Rena while she tries to sleep (eyes open)

***Caption (Rena)***

I tried to sleep, but I couldn't.

Instead, I laid in bed, eyes open, thinking about what happened earlier that day.

I wonder if I had actually made a friend. Aside from my sister. I didn't really have anyone I was close to. It felt nice to talk to someone.

I thouhgt about what we talked about, and wondered how Reina would have felt if she really did find me laying on the ground, probably bleeding all of the place, after getting hit by a car.

### Key Scene: Rena's mangled bike on residential street

***Narration (Rena)***

Did that actually happen?

If so, what happened after?

Does Reina blame herself?

### Dark Void

***Narration (Rena)***

I rolled over. Just as my eyes started to close, I heard the door to our room open.

### Key Scene: Reina standing in the doorway with her kistune, still in her magical girl form

***Caption (Rena)***

She's came back. I had no idea what time it was, but I knew it was late.

Just where had she been?

What was she wearing?

I had a hard time believing she'd miss dinner and get home so late because of a cosplay party.

**Caption (Reina's Kistune)**

You look exhausted.

***Narration (Rena)***

It talked!?

It did just talk right!?

That fox-like stuffed animal, just talked!

I tried to roll back over and close my eyes. Maybe I'm still dreaming!?

**Caption (Reina)**

I don't know if I'm cut out for this!

### White Void

***Narration (Rena)***

My eyes shot open again, and a turned back around as the room filled with a bright light.

### Rena's room, dark

**Reina's Kitsune, neutral**

I'll admit your magic is still a bit weak, and it may not exactly be good for offense, but I think you're doing well.

**Reina, casual summer, worried**

If you say so.

**Reina's Kitsune, neutral**

That nightmare was pretty power, and you still beat it.

But if, you're really worried why not find an ally?

Healers are best when paired with someone who can really do damage.

**Reina, casual summer, thinking**

I couldn't. I mean I don't know any other magical girls.

**Reina's Kistune, neutral**

I bet your sister...

**Reina, casual summer, cross**

I did this to *save* her, not put her in danger!

***Narration (Rena)***

Reina stormed out of the room. The fox-like creature perched itself on one of her dressers, making itself look like a proper stuffie.

I was left wondering what all this talk about magical girls was, and just what this fox-like thing was.

Also, Reina said she saved me. Does that mean I really was hit? Did she use magic to heal me?

...

Was there even such a thing as magic?

I fell asleep before I could ask her.

### Ikumi residence, kitchen

***Narration (Rena)***

I wasn't at all surprised to find the room empty when I woke up. There wasn't even any sign of that fox.

I changed and headed downstairs. I was surprised to see Reina there. I looked at her, she was reading while eating again.

I cleared my throat, hoping she'd notice.

...

She didn't. I glanced at the clock, plenty of time before we had to leave.

I plopped down next to her. Mother and father were no where to be found. Now was my chance.

**Rena, school girl summer, smiling**

Good morning!

**Reina, school girl summer, neutral**

'morning

**Rena, school girl summer, neutral**

*(That was usually as far as our 'conversations' went over the last few days.)*

*(But, I had questions that needed answers.)*

*(About her feelings...)*

*(And about last night.)*

Y-you...

*(Reina finished her toast, and was closed her book. She was about to stand up, but I grabbed her arm.)*

**Rena, school girl summer, tearing up**

Can't you talk to me?

**Reina, school girl summer, ashamed**

...

I...

I-I have day duty.

**Rena, school girl summer, tearing up**

Please. I'll give you a ride, just let me talk to you.

**Reina, school girl summer, ashamed**

...

**Rena, school girl summer, crying**

A-Are you mad at me?

### Key Scene: Reina suddenly hugs Rena while she cries in the kitchen

**Caption (Reina)**

I'm not mad.

I could never be mad at you.

**Caption (Rena)**

Can you tell me something?

**Caption (Reina)**

...

**Caption (Rena)**

I was hit by a car wasn't I?

### Ikumi Residence, kitchen

**Reina, school girl summer, surprised**

Are you talking about you're dream?

**Rena, school girl summer, tearing up**

It wasn't a dream, was it?

Mom and dad aren't here.

Y-you c-can tell me.

**Reina, school girl summer, neutral**

...

**Rena, school girl summer, neutral**

Just tell me you aren't doing something dangerous.

**Reina, school girl summer, neutral**

We should go.

### Key Scene: Reina riding on the back of Rena's bike

***Caption (Rena)***

As I rode to school with my sister on my bike in silence, I was left wondering if she had also fixed it. From what I remember it was pretty badly damaged.

I couldn't believe *that's* where my mind went!

She didn't tell me anything, nor did she promise she wasn't doing anything dangerous.

Eventually she asked me about a manga I had been reading.

It wasn't what I wanted to talk about, but at least she was talking to me again.
