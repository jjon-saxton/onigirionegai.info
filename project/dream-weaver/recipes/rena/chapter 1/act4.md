Scene

### Chuou Ward Library, ext., afternoon

***Narration (Rena)***

Once we got to school Reina spent the day with me, instead of avoiding me like she had done yesterday.

The girl I spoke to seemed to notice. She didn't come near us, but she did smile and give me a thumbs up.

I didn't really know if I could take credit, but I was happy Reina was talking to me again.

She never brought up what had really happened to me though, and I didn't push it.

### Chuou Ward Library, int., afternoon

***Narration (Rena)***

The weather didn't look to good after school, so we headed for the library, just like we used to.

I was happy.

Only it wouldn't last.

As I was browsing the manga section, I heard Rena talking. I could only assume her little fox friend was talking to her.

**Reina, school girl summer, worried**

Here!?

**Reina's Kitsune, neutral**

Not here, but close.

**Reina, school girl summer, worried**

Is Rena in danger?

**Reina's Kistune, neutral**

You know how large a palace can be.

***Narration (Rena)***

I couldn't just stay quite. I didn't know what exactly was going on, but I knew one thing...

**Rena, school girl summer, neutral**

You're leaving aren't you?

**Reina, school girl summer, surprised**

...

**Reina, school girl summer, neutral**

I-I have to go.

**Rena, school girl summer, forced smile**

I won't stop you.

Just tell me, what are you doing that an adult can't do for you?

Is it something dangerous?

**Reina, school girl summer, tearing up**

Y-you're making this hard.

**Rena, school girl summer, tearing up**

I don't mean to.

I'm just worried.

I heard someone talking about nightmares and palaces.

**Reina, school girl summer, surprised**

...

**Reina, school girl summer, neutral**

I have to go.

### White void

***Narration (Rena)***

Just like I promised I didn't stop her.

There was a flash of light and I could see her running from the library.

It hurt to watch her leave like that, especially not knowing what she was running towards.

### Key Scene: Heart crack

***Narration (Rena)***

It felt like something was ripping my chest apart.

It hurt so much to know that my sister was doing something without me.

Not only that, but I knew it was something dangerous, and she was doing it to protect me.

I'm the oldest!! **ME**!!

Sure it was only by a few minutes, but I was still older and I wanted to be the one protecting *her*.

Was I just being selfish.

That's the real me right!?

...

The most selfish girl in class...

Rena Ikumi...

The girl who can't be bothered to care about anyone but herself.

### Chuou Ward Library, int., afternoon

**Rena's Kitsune, neutral**

You know that's not correct.

**Rena, school girl summer, shocked**

What!?

*(It was a fox-like creature just like the one Reina had with her, but I knew it wasn't the same one. That one was on her shoulder when she ran off.)*

**Rena's Kitsune, neutral**

You're not really selfish, and you know it.

**Rena, school girl summer, inquisitive**

Who...

What are you!?

**Rena's Kitsune, neutral**

I'm a kitsune (fox spirit), and my job is to find girls like you and grant them the power to fulfill their desire.

So, Miss Rena Ikumi, what do you desire?

### White void

**Rena, school girl summer, worried**

*(What do I desire?)*

***Choices, eos***

1. I want to know what happened to me!
2. I just want to know if my sister is okay.
3. I want to protect my sister.
4. Nothing! Leave me alone!
