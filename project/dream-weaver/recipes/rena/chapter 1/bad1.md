### Chuou Ward Library, int., afternoon

***Narration (Rena)***

What do I desire?

Just what exactly was this thing!?

What was she talking about!?

Girls like me? What did she mean?

Grant me the power to fulfill my desires...

Yeah, right, sure.

How could she possibly do that when even I wasn't sure what it was that I wanted.

**Rena, school girl summer, haughty**

Nothing! Leave me alone!

**Rena's Kitsune, neutral**

Its too bad, you had such potential.

I'll be back when you change your mind.

### Black Void

***Narration (Rena)***

I heard tiny footsteps. They kept getting softer, and softer.

### Key Scene: Rena in the bath, head half under water, blowing bubbles

***Caption (Rena)***

I headed home.

I knew I had come from the library, but that seemed so strange.

I didn't really like books, I mean I wasn't even fond of manga.

What was I doing there?

Once I got home, I headed straight for the bath.

I felt like something was missing. Maybe I went to the library to find it.

My mind conjured an image of myself, only it was dressed in an outfit I would never wear.

What was I missing?

### Black Void

***Narration***

Reina is now missing.

Rena doesn't remember her.

**Choice, eoc**

1. Try again (returns player to act 4)
2. Game over (returns player to character select)
