### Key Scene: Heart breaks

***Narration (Rena)***

As I watched my sister cowered in fear. The nightmare a huge, monsterous thing covered in muscle an blood. Even from her I could see Reina's knees shaking.

She readied her bow. It shook as she rose it. It shook as she drew back a bow string made of light.

I was completely unprepared for any of this. Magical girls, monsters, the thick metallic smell in the air. It was all foreign.

The monsters threw up a hand ready to strike my sister. I could almost hear her crying as an arrow mounted itself between the bow and string.

I closed my eyes. Fear had a hold on me too. I couldn't move. I sunk to my knees and buried my head in my hands.

**Caption (Rena)**

I don't want this!

## Black Void

**Rena's Kitsune, neutral**

Its too bad, you had such potential.

***Narration (Rena)***

I heard tiny footsteps. They kept getting softer, and softer.

I lifted my head and opened my eyes.

### Key Scene: Rena's Kitsune walks away from the battle

**Caption (Rena)**

I want to call out to it, but I couldn't find my voice.

I just watched as the fox-spirit walked away, its tail waving ever so slightly, almost mocking me.

I turned toward my sister.

She was no where to be found.

All I saw was the nightmare.

Its hand lifed up in the air. It was so close.

I knew what came next.

### Black Void.

***Narration (Rena)***

I had died once already, but I didn't remember that.

Still, maybe death would prove to be a relief.

I guess it wouldn't be long before I found out.

***Narration***

Rena is dead.

**Choice, eoc**

1. Try again (returns player to act 5)
