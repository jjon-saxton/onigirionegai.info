Scene

### Chuou Ward residential street

***Narration***

-Chuou Ward, Sakura-

***Caption (Rena)***

I always loved Chuou. Even if it seemed it was stuck in the past, it had everything I could want...

### Chuou Ward beach

***Caption (Rena)***

Warm beaches with cool water...

### Chuou Ward park

***Caption (Rena)***

I nice park, with lots equipment...

### Chuou cliffside store

***Caption (Rena)***

Old convience stores still run by local families...

### Chuou Middle School

***Caption (Rena)***

A charming school still stuck in the past, just like everything else in Chuou...

### Ikumi Residence

***Caption (Rena)***

Most importantly, though, it is my home. That means Chuou ward had the most important thing in the world to me...

### Ikumi Residence, Living Room

**Reina, casual, embarassed**

Is there something on my face?

**Rena, casual, shocked**

W-what!?

**Reina, casual, smiling**

You were staring at me.

**Rena, casual, blushing**

N-no I wasn't!

**Reina, casual, smiling**

Okay.

***Caption (Rena, Reina still on screen)***

It had my twin sister, Reina.

Reina and I used to do everything together. We'd walk to school together. We'd walk home together. We'd do homework together.

On nice days, when we had extra time, we'd go to the beach together, and, if the weather wasn't so nice, we'd go to a library.

I wasn't much for reading, but I enjoyed browsing manga while my sister read. Truthfully I just enjoyed being with her, and, if that meant pretending to read some trashy manga, I'd do it!

### Chuou Ward residential street

***Narration (Rena)***

I'm Rena Ikumi, my sister's Reina Ikumi...

That doesn't get confusing at all...

Anyway we are both sixth graders at Chuou Middle School. In case you werent' paying attention, we're twins.

We lived a nice, peaceful life with our mother and father in Chuou Ward. Nothing in Chuou Ward has been rebuilt or renovated since the 1990's, so its like stepping into the past.

You may have noticed, I said we 'lived' a nice, peaceful life. One day, that would all change...

For the first time since we started school together, I had to go home without my sister. I was held back to help out with one of the athletic clubs, but I didn't want to hold my sister back.

I'd like to say we didn't fight over it, but, I think I *did* raise my voice when I told her to just go home.

I wouldn't know just how that one decision would effect us...

### Key Scene: Rena's mangled bike on residential street

***Caption (Rena)***

I didn't know where it came from. I didn't even realize what had happened. One minute I was on my bike, the next my bike was quite a meter away and I was lying on the street.

I was in a lot of pain...

That was wierd enough, but, what happened later, that was even wierder...

I heard someone crying. Maybe it was Reina, I couldn't be sure. Everything went dark after that.

### Rena and Reina's bedroom

**Rena, pajamas, wincing**

What happened?

***Narration (Rena)***

I wasn't in any pain at all. I looked down and I was in my pajamas, on my bed. The lights were on. Had I fallen asleep? That doesn't make sense.

**Reina, pajamas, smiling**

You were dreaming. I had to wake you up. What were you dreaming about?

***Narration (Rena)***

Dreaming!? That couldn't be right. I don't remember getting home. I don't remember taking a bath or changing! I answered her anyways.

**Rena, pajamas, worried**

I think I was in an accident. Someone hit me!

**Reina, pajamas, smiling**

It was just a dream.

***Narration (Rena)***

I knew that wasn't right, but I didn't question her. Maybe she had a good reason for lying to me. Maybe, she'd tell me someday. Of course, I had no idea what really happened, not then, not for awhile.

### Chuou Middle School

**Reina, school girl, smiling**

I'm going on ahead.

**Rena, school girl, neutral**

Wait! I'm almost done, we'll go home together.

**Reina, school girl, smiling**

Its fine, don't rush yourself.

***Narration (Rena)***

After my accident, or dream, or whatever it was, Reina never seemed to want to walk home with me. We still went to school together, but she was unusually quiet.

On nice days, I'd go to the beach like I usually did, but Reina wouldn't come with me.

On bad days, I'd still go to the library, but Reina usually wouldn't stay. When she did, she didn't say much.

In fact she never seemed to talk to me anymore...

I didn't know what I did...

I just wanted my sister back!
