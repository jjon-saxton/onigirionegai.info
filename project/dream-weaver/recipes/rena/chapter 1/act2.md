### Chuou cliffside store, ext., late afternoon

***Narration (Rena)***

When I looked up, Reina had already gone. It seems she was happy to go home without me today too.

I left school with a classmate and headed for a convience store not too far from school. I didn't want to take her to far out of her way.

### Generic convienence store

**Generic sixth grader, long hair**

You're letting me get anything?

**Rena, school girl summer, annoyed**

Just pick something!

**Generic sixth grader, long hair**

Fine.

***Narration (Rena)***

While my new friend, I mean, do I even call her a friend yet? While my classmate looked over the candy, I grabbed a small bag of sriracha cashews.

I'm not too fund of sweets. I mean, I'm still a sixth-grader and I wouldn't say no to chocolate or fruit snacks, but overly sweet candy...that's a pass.

**Generic sixth grader, long hair**

So, what happened between you and your sister?

**Rena, school girl summer, annoyed**

Not here, dummy!

**Generic sixth grader, long hair**

Still not going to tell me.

**Rena, school girl summer, annoyed and blushing**

I'll tell you, but, pick something first!

**Generic sixth grader, long hair**

Got it!

***Narration (Rena)***

She picked a few suckers. They weren't very expensive, so I picked up a few of the flavors she discarded and added them just to make sure they were around the same price as my nuts.

### Chuou Ward, under the bridge

**Rena, school girl summer, neutral**

That day I helped you out. Reina and I had a fight, because she wanted to stay and wait for me.

**Generic sixth grader, long hair**

You didn't want her to?

**Rena, school girl summer, neutral**

If it got dark, I could just ride my bike home. I mean, I really wasn't thinking, because I *could* have just had her ride on the back like I always do.

**Generic sixth grader, long hair**

But maybe you were worried that you'd have a hard time riding fast if she was there.

**Rena, school girl summer, blushing**

Maybe. Either way I told her to go home. I didn't just tell her...

I yelled it at her!

I was surpised no one in class noticed.

**Generic sixth grader, long hair**

So you think she's made at you for yelling at her?

**Rena, school girl summer, thoughtful**

I don't know, there's something else...

### Key Scene: Rena's mangled bike on residential street

**Caption (Rena)**

On my way back I was riding down the hill just above our house. Next thing I know I'm on the street in a lot of pain, my bike was like a meter away.

**Caption (Classmate)**

You were hit!? Wasn't that just yesterday ago?

**Caption (Rena)**

That's what I remember, but then everything went dark. Next thing I knew I was in my pajamas under my covers in my room.

### Chuou Ward, under the bridge

**Generic sixth grader, long hair**

A dream!?

**Rena, school girl summer, thoughtful**

That's what Reina said, but it felt so real.

**Generic sixth grader, long hair**

You couldn't have been hit though, right? I mean not really.

**Rena, school girl summer, angry**

Why not!?

**Generic sixth grader, long hair**

You don't look like you were hurt.

**Rena, school girl summer, angry**

So I must be lying then!

**Generic sixth grader, long hair**

I didn't say that, and you know it!

**Rena, school girl summer, neutral**

I-I'm sorry. I-I'm just so confused.

**Generic sixth grader, long hair**

So you remember being in an accident.

Then you passed out.

Then you were in your room and your sister claimed you were dreaming, but you know it was real, right?

**Rena, school girl summer, neutral**

*-nod-*

**Generic sixth grader, long hair**

Say you were really hit. Why are you fine now?

**Rena, school girl summer, thoughtful**

I don't know, but it couldn't be a dream, and I couldn't have imagined it.

**Generic sixth grader, long hair**

Okay, say it really happened and say your sister saw.

How do you think she'd feel, especially after your fight?

Do you think she could blame herself as much you blame yourself?

**Rena, school girl summer, surprised**

So, we're just avoiding each other because we blame ourselves for what happened?

**Generic sixth grader, long hair**

Dunno. You'll have to talk to your sister, but I bet that's it.

Thanks for the suckers.

**Rena, school girl summer, blushing with tears**

Do you think I'm a terrible person?

**Generic sixth grader, long hair**

I think...

I think you just don't know how to express yourself sometimes.

Deep down, I bet you're really sweet.

***Narration (Rena)***

My classmate got up and left right after that. All I could think about was how she said I was probably really sweet.

I don't know if she meant it, or she was just trying to make me feel better, but I knew I really cared about my sister.

If that made me sweet, than fine, I'd live with it. Nothing wrong with being sweet, right?

### Ikumi residence, hallway, outside bathroom

***Caption***

*-knock- -knock-*

**Rena, casual, worried**

Reina, are you in there?

*(She wasn't at dinner, and I didn't see her in our room.)*

*(There wasn't an answer. Where was she?)*

**Rena, casual, tearing up**

*(I just wanted her to know she doesn't need to blame herself.)*
