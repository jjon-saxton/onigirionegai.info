Scene
-----

### Chuou Ward Library, int., afternoon

**Rena, school girl summer, thoughful**

I want to know what happened to me!

**Rena's kitsune, neutral**

Is that all?

It isn't even worth a contract.

**Rena, school girl summer, determined**

So you won't tell me?

**Rena's kitsune, neutral**

If it will help you discover what you truly desire, I'll *show* you.

**Rena, school girl summer, determined**

*-nods-*

### Key Scene: Rena's mangled bike on a residential road

**Caption (Rena's kitsune)**

This is all you remember correct?

**Caption (Rena)**

I was thrown off my bike. I remember seeing in like a meter away from me. It was badly bent out of shape.

**Caption (Rena's kitsune)**

Your sister said it was a dream, but you don't believe that do you?

**Caption (Rena)**

It seemed to real. I can still remember the pain I felt, like a scratchy burn all over my body, and a sharp pain in my neck and the side of my head.

### Key Scene: Rena lying in the road, covered in blood, far from her bike

**Caption (Rena's kitsune)**

You probably remember the warm wetness of blood running down your face too.

That was no dream. You had been hit by a small moving truck as you rode down the hill near you home.

You were so close to the house that your sister, Reina, who was already out the door on her way to look for you, could hear the screetch of the brakes and the metal frame of you bike smacking the pavement.

### Chuou Ward Library, int., afternoon

**Rena, school girl summer, worried**

Did I die?

**Rena's kitsune, neutral**

You *could* have.

Your neck was broken.

At the very least you would have been paralized.

**Rena, school girl summer, shocked**

But I'm okay!

**Rena's kitsune, neutral**

One of my sisters appeared to Reina. She offered her the same power I'm offering you. Do you want to know what her desire was?

**Rena, school girl summer, neutral**

I know.

She wanted to save me, didn't she?

**Rena's kitsune, neutral**

That's right, she only said, "please let me save my sister."

Reina was given healing powers and the ability to repair just about anything. She used that power to fix your bike and heal your wounds.

She didn't want you know, so she hid it all from you and tried to fight on her own, but her offensive power is very weak.

**Rena, school girl summer, worried**

Is this dangerous?

**Rena's kistune, neutral**

She could very well be killed by a nightmare, but, she's been lucky thus far.

### Key Scene: Heart breaks

**Caption (Rena's Kitsune)**

Have you found a desire worth your soul?

**Caption (Rena)**

I only have one desire.

**Caption (Rena's Kitsune)**

Is it strong enough to make your soul shine?

**Caption (Rena)**

I don't care, its all I want! I want to protect my sister!

**Caption (Rena's Kitsune)**

Then, Miss Rena Ikumi, will you make a contract with me?

**Caption (Rena)**

Let me see her.

### Key Scene: Rena runs after her kitsune

**no text**

### Key Scene: A wild nightmare appears!

**Caption (Rena's Kitsune)**

In her present state, a victory against a nightmare isn't assured.

**Caption (nightmare)**

RRRRAGGGH!

**Caption (Rena)**

You mean, that thing could *kill* her!

**Caption (Rena's kistune)**

It is possible.

I ask again will you make a contract with me?

***Choice, eos***

1. I will! (true ending)
2. I don't want this! (bad ending 2)
