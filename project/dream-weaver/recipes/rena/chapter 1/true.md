### Key Scene: Rena's Heart Seed

***Narration (Rena)***

The pain in my chest grew so much I didn't know if I could bare it any more.

Just when I thought I would pass out and be swallowed by the gaping hole left, a warmth washed over me.

The pain vanished and so do the hole in my chest.

In my hand was a heart shaped jewel.

**Caption (Rena's Kitsune)**

A new heart seed is born! Now, embrace your power!
