### Reina's bedroom, afternoon

**Reina, school girl summer, angry**

Rena's such an idiot!

Aarrrgh!!

Why wouldn't she just let me wait!?

It can't be *that* dangerous.

Nothing in Chuou is *that* dangerous!

Stupid sister!

I wish she'd just die!!

**Narration (Unknown Voice)**

You should be careful what you wish for.

**Reina, school girl summer, surprised**

W-who's there!

***Narration (Reina)***

I looked around the room...

I was alone.

Looking back now, I wish I never made that wish.

Maybe it had nothing to do with what happened, and maybe it didn't, but either way, I shouldn't have said that.

Not a word of it.

...

I sat down at my desk, and started on my homework, but all I could think about was that my sister wasn't there. Of course, right about now, she'd be bugging me to just let her copy me...

I'd say no, of course, she'd put up a fight, but eventually, begrudingly, continue working.

I turned to her desk.

Naturally, it was empty.

**Reina, school girl summer, neutral**

Are you done sharing everything with me?

Am I just a burden now?

### Key Scene: Heart cracks

**Caption (Reina)**

We used to share everything.

Up until we fourth grade we even shared a desk and a bed. We took baths together.

We're older now so mom and dad bought me my own desk and my own bed.

Rena and I take baths seperately.

It felt like we were drifting further about the older we got.

I didn't want that, but maybe its *exactly* what Rena wanted.

We were twins, and not just twins, *identical* twins, but we couldn't be more different as people.

### Reina bedroom, late afternoon

**Reina, school girl summer, worried**

They really are keeping her pretty late huh?

Rena...

***Narration (Reina)***

I felt a sudden chill just as I said her name. Then I had a strange feeling.

I wondered outside and walked just passed our house.

### Key Scene: Rena in the road, battered, bike broken far from her

***Caption (Reina)***

Just up the road, about a block from the house their was a hill.

At the base of that hill there was a cross street.

This was always tricky when Rena rode home.

I got that hill.

I saw Rena speeding down and her bike.

I was about to raise my hand and call to her when there was a sudden screech.

Moments later, Rena was on the street her bike was so far from where she landed and was bent so badly I don't know if anyone would see it as a bike anymore.

Rena wasn't moving.

### Key Scene: Heart breaks

***Narration (Reina)***

I ran over to her. I could feel the tears streaming across my face.

I remember thinking:

*she had to be okay*

*she had to be okay*

There was just so much blood though...

The driver got out of the car and went to check on her.

I know he said something to me, but I didn't understand.

I just cried.

**Reina's kitsune, neutral**

Do you want to save her?

**Reina, school girl summer, sobbing**

S-save her?

**Reina's kitsune, neutral**

I sense a lot of potential in you, and she isn't dead yet.

I think you could heal her.

You just need to make a contract.

**Reina, school girl summer, sobbing**

I'll do anything!

Please help my sister!

I don't want to lose her!

**Reina's kistune, neutral**

Would the power to heal others make your soul shine?

I wonder.

**Reina, school girl summer, sobbing**

Just save her please!

### Black void

***Narration (Reina)***

I closed my eyes and pleading with all my might.

**Caption (Reina's kitsune)**

You misunderstand. *I* can't do anything for her, all I can do is grant you the power to fufill your desires.

So Miss Reina Ikumi, is your desire to help your sister?

**Caption (Reina)**

Yes!

***Narration (Reina)***

A sudden warmth washed over me.

It grew so intense I thought I'd burn to death.

### Reina's pure heartseed

***Narration (Reina)***

I opened my eyes. Floating just in front of them was a heart-shaped object.

**Reina's kitsune, neutral**

Embrace your new power!

Save your sister!

***Narration (Reina)***

A grabbed the object and pulled it close to my body.

A felt warm again, but this time it wasn't so burning hot.

It looked like the heart-shaped object was absorbed into my body and I transformed into a magical girl for the first time.

### Key Scene: Reina, as a magical girl, embraces her battered sister

***Caption (Reina)***

The blood slowly disappeared.

I don't know what happened to the man after I transformed, and I didn't much care.

Soon Rena felt warm in my arms again.

**Caption (Reina's kitsune)**

It wasn't my intention to decieve you, but this power I gave you isn't free.

**Caption (Reina, eos)**

I don't care, whatever price it is, I'll pay it.

It'll be worth it to have my sister with me again.
