### Reina's room, evening, lit

***Narration (Reina)***

After I healed my sister I carried her back to our room. Where I began to ask questions...

**Reina (casual summer, neutral)**

So, what do you want from me?

**Reina's kitsune, neutral**

In this world there are many who lose track of their dreams or lose hope in themselves.

When you lost your sister, you almost lost your hope.

In other words, your heart almost broke.

**Reina (casual summer, surprised)**

My heart broke!?

**Reina's kitsune, neutral**

Almost! I stopped it by reinforcing it with a heartseed.

Its that heartseed that gives you your power as a magical girl.

### Reina's Heartseed, pure

***Narration (Reina)***

After returning to my normal self, the heartseed became a locket that I wore around my neck.

I quickly discovered that I could just think of it in its full form and it would appear just as it did when a first saw it, floating just in front of me.

**Caption (Reina)**

So this protects my heart?

### Reina's room, evening, lit

**Reina's Kitsune, neutral**

Yes, but not everyone can become a magical girl, and only magical girls have heartseeds.

**Reina (casual summer, worried)**

What happens to the others, to those that can't be magical girls?

**Reina's Kitsune, neutral**

There hearts will break, they lose all hope, and are no longer able to fulfill their desires, or the destiny.

They become nightmares.

Or they give in to what others want from them and set aside their own desires.

They are lost and become phantoms.

Phantoms are attracted to nightmares and become their soldiers.

Nightmares work to make everyone around them as miserable as themselves by breaking their hearts.

As a magical girl, your job is to stop them!

**Reina (casual summer, neutral)**

Is that what you want from me? To fight those things?

**Reina's kitsune, neutral**

That was the price I spoke of.

**Reina (casual summer, neutral)**

Is that all?

**Reina's kitsune, neutral**

Even with a heartseed you aren't immune to nightmares. You heart can still break.

Also, if the heartseed itself is destroyed, you will die.

In other words, you *will* be putting your life at risk when you fight.

**Reina (casual summer, smiling)**

But Rena will be safe, I can make sure of that, right?

**Reina's kitsune, neutral**

That was the desire that formed your contract.

Not only *can* you make ensure her safety, but you *must* ensure it!

If you don't your heart *will* break!

**Reina (casual summer, smiling)**

As long as she's safe, I'll be fun though, right?

**Reina's kitsune, neutral**

You're heart won't break, but you could still die.

You have to understand that!

**Reina (casual summer, neutral)**

I understand.

### Key Scene: Reina fights random phantoms in a random labryinth

***Narration (Reina, eos)***

After that I decided the best way to protect my sister was to do just what the mysterious demigod wanted.

I would fight.

I would do what I could to continue to fight.

I would live!

Most importantly, Rena would never find out about any of this.

She'd never know about magical girls, or kitsune, or phantoms, or nightmares.

None of it.

I would fight for her sake, alone!

Or so I thought...
