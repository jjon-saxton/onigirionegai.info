### Ikumi Residence, ext, morning

***Caption***

-Chuou Ward, Sakura-

***Narration (Reina)***

M-my name is Reina Ikumi.

I'm a sixth grader at Chuou Middle School.

I used to live a normal life in our nice house with my mother and father.

### Reina's bedroom, morning

***Narration (Reina)***

Our house was nice, but it wasn't the biggest house and I had to share a room with my twin sister, Rena.

That's okay though.

We share everything.

Not that I really mind, but I think she does, sometimes.

### Chuou Middle School, hallway

***Narration (Reina)***

When I said I used to live in our nice house with my mother, father, and sister and didn't mean that really changed.

What I meant was, my life became a little less normal.

That happened the day I became a megical girl.

### Chuou Middle School, classroom, morning

***Narration (Reina)***

But I guess I should start at the beginning, huh?

Its hard for you to understand when you don't know what really happened.

The day started out normally, well, relatively.

Most days Rena and I had plenty of time in the morning and would usually walk to school together.

This day, like just a few like it, we were a bit late so Rena had me ride on the back of her bike with her.

It gave us a chance to get to school on time.

That wasn't really that wierd, but its important.

### Chuou Middle School classroom, afternoon

**Generic sixth grade girl, long hair**

Rena?

**Rena, school girl summer, annoyed**

What do you want?

**Generic sixth grade girl, long hair**

Do you think you could help out the soccer club?

One of the players is out sick and we can't find her back up.

**Rena, school girl summer, annoyed**

So you want *me* to help?

**Generic sixth grade girl, long hair**

Please, you'd really be saving my neck here!

***Narration (Reina)***

My twin has always been athletic. She perfers swimming, but she's good at just about anything that gets her body moving.

I was sure she'd be good at soccer too, and so was our classmate.

Of course, Rena didn't really seem to like people so she never joined any of the clubs.

I was pretty sure she'd just flat out turn her down.

**Rena, school girl summer, haughty**

If I do this for you, you'd own me, right?

**Generic sixth grade girl, long hair**

Sure! Whatever. You'll do it right?

***Narration (Reina)***

Pretending that I didn't hear everything she just said I approached her.

I was expecting everything would play out just as it normally did.

Boy would I be surprised!

**Reina, school girl summer, smiling**

Are you ready to go yet?

**Rena, school girl summer, neutral**

U-um, about that...

**Reina, school girl summer, inquisitive**

What?

**Rena, school girl summer, fidgiting**

Y-you know I don't have many friends, right?

**Reina, school girl summer, inquisitive**

I guess. They just don't get you, you know.

**Rena, school girl summer, neutral**

I know I'm a terrible person, but one of our classmates asked for my help. I didn't say yes, at first, but-

**Reina, school girl summer, neutral**

But, you eventually thought maybe you could make friends?

**Rena, school girl summer, neutral**

I know it's stupid, but, yeah, I agreed, and they want me to help now, after school.

**Reina, school girl summer, smiling**

Then I'll just wait for you.

We can still walk home together.

**Rena, school girl summer, neutral**

I hear they usually get out pretty late, you know the narrow streets get dangerous once people start heading home.

**Reina, school girl summer, smiling**

Then we'll just tendem ride, it'll be fine.

**Rena, school girl summer, mad**

Look, I don't want you getting hurt because of me so just go home without me!

**Reina, school girl summer, smiling**

*-shakes head-*

I'll be fine.

**Rena, school girl summer, mad**

Just go home!

Stop being a brat!

***Narration (Reina)***

Rena had a sharp tongue some times, but she had never directed it at me.

I was so surprised.

It shook me.

### Key Scene: Heart cracks

***Narration (Reina)***

I had never though she'd yell at me and over something so small.

Maybe I was just being a brat.

Maybe I just wanted to always spend time with my twin sister.

Was there time she didn't want to share with me?

### Chuou Middle School classroom, afternoon

**Reina, school girl summer, deflated**

**small:**O-okay.

***Narration (Reina)***

I turned and headed straight for the door.

I looked back before sliding it open.

Rena had tears in her eyes, but still wore the same mean expression.

Little did I know this one choice would change both our lives forever.
