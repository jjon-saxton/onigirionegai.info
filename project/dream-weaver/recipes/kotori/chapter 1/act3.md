## Scene 

### Key Scene: Kotori's father and brother dead in the labyrinth

**_Narration (Kotori)_**

I didn't stay because I wanted to.

I didn't even decide to stay.

It felt more like I just had to.

I didn't know why.

Maybe it was something about this new labyrinth.

Maybe it was the pungent metallic scent that sent shivers all over.

All I knew for sure was what I felt when I saw my brother's body...

**Caption (Kotori)**

*-sigh-*

**_Narration (Kotori)_**

I wasn't sad.

I wasn't disgusted.

I wasn't even angry at first.

I was just relieved.

### City labyrinth, building

**Kotori's kitsune, natural**

Oh my...

Are you okay?

**Kotori, magical girl, relieved**

F-Fine.

*-sigh-*

I'm really fine!

**Kotori's kitsune, neutral**

Kotori?

**_Narration (Kotori)_**

I looked at my brother's body, then traced the blood and found my father too.

They'd never hurt me again.

I almost smiled...

**City phantom, attacking**

Argh!

**Kotori, magical girl, hurt**

Ah!

Hey!

**Kotori, magical girl, attacking**

Don't spoil this!

**_Narration (Kotori)_**

After defeating the phantom, I noticed something...

...

My step-brother and step-father were not the only ones killed...

...

Within this strange building just coming into view...

Were the bodies of my mother and younger sister!

**Kotori, magical girl, devastated**

No!

Mom, sis!

Nooo!!

**Kotori, magical girl, enraged**

Where is it!?

Where is the nightmare!?

**Kotori's kitsune, neutral**

Calm down!

### Key Scene: Kotori and her kitsune watch Horror Kotori's house burn

**_Narration (Kotori)_**

To be honest, I'm not sure what happened next.

Everything was just a blur.

I thought I had to have defeated the nightmare somehow, because the labyrinth was gone, but I don't remember doing it.

The next thing a remember was setting fire to my old house.

The bodies of my family were still there and I didn't want to answer any questions about how they died, so I turned in the gas and lit a match.

**Caption (Kotori's kitsune)**

What will you do now?

**Caption (Kotori, eoc)**

Now I kill every last nightmare and make sure this doesn't happen to anyone else!
