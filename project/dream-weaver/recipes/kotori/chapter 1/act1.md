## Scene

### Mizuno Middle School classroom, afternoon

**Kotori, summer school uniform, smiling**

And then you just add these together...

**Generic 7th grade girl, long hair**

Wow!

You that really helps!

You're a great teacher, Kotori-chan.

**Kotori, summer school uniform, blushing**

You think so?

**Generic 7th grade girl, long hair**

Better than the teacher!

**Generic 7th grade girl, pony tail**

Hey Kotori-chan!

A friend and I are going to the Game Center after school, wanna come?

**Kotori, summer school uniform, smiling**

I promised I'd help the cooking club.

Maybe we can go some other time?

**Generic 7th grade girl, pony tail, grinning**

They have a new idol figure in that UFO catcher you like...

**Kotori, summer school uniform, surprised**

Its not...

**Generic 7th grade girl, grinning**

I'm not saying!

**Kotori, summer school uniform, determined**

No!

I can't let you tempt me!

**_Narration (Kotori)_**

School wasn't always like this for me.

I used to be kind of withdrawn and shy.

I'd never even talk to any one.

Making friends...

Going to arcades...

Helping classmates...

Those were all things I would never have done at my old school.

### Kotori's heart, cracked 

**_Narration (Kotori)_**

When I met that mysterious creature, the one calling itself a demigod fox, everything changed.

It offered me the power to change my own path, all it wanted in return was my help fighting things called nightmares.

For a girl like me, that was a small price.

### Key Scene: A beaten Kotori crying next to her bed

**_Narration (Kotori)_**

My step-brother has just finished venting all his frustrations out on my young body when the creature appeared.

I had closed my eyes hoping to just forget what just happened...

### Black void 

**_Narration _**

...

**Kotori's kitsune, neutral**

That looked rough.

### Kotori's bedroom, night/dark

**Kotori, pajamas, worried**

W-who...

W-what...

**Kotori's kitsune, neutral**

I'm just a passing demigod.

I've come to offer you the power to make your desired reality.

**Kotori, pajamas, neutral**

You mean, like grant me a wish?

**Kotori's kitsune, neutral**

We don't deal in something as pedestrian as wishes.

What we offer is power.

Power for you to get what you really want.

Say you wished for me to free you from this life...

That could mean so many things.

In fact, the easiest thing for me to do to fulfill that wish, would be to kill that step-brother.

**Kotori, pajamas, determined**

**Small**:Sounds fine to me.

**Kotori's kitsune, neutral**

What if you didn't really think that?

Who would you blame?

So, what if I just gave you enough power that *you* could do it.

It'd be up to you how you use it.

In the end only you really know what you want.

Do you accept your power?

Miss Kotori Ai, will you form a contract with me?

**Kotori, pajamas, thinking**

Can you really give me the power to escape my brother and my father?

**Kotori's kitsune, neutral**

If that's the desire that will set your soul ablaze, then certainly.

**Kotori, pajamas, determined**

Where do I sign?

### Kotori's heartseed, pure

**Caption (Kotori's kitsune)**

That's just a figure of speech.

You don't actually sign anything.

Just hold your glowing soul, and embrace your new power!

**_Narration (Kotori)_**

A glowing, heart-shaped object appeared in front of me.

I couldn't believe this was meant to be my "soul", but it had to be what the creature was talking about.

I held it in my arms.

It felt warm.

I squeezed it tightly and it disappeared into my chest.

### Key Scene: Kotori stands in her room as a new magical girl

**_Nation (Kotori, eos)_**

My body was suddenly so warm it felt like I was on fire.

But I wasn't afraid.

From the reflection in my mirror I knew I wasn't exactly the same person.

I was wearing something I'd never seen before.

Was I a magical girl, like the ones I'd seen on TV and in comics?

Was that even possible?
