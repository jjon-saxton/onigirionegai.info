## Scene

### Black void

***Narration (Kotori's kitsune)***

We aren't genie's.

We don't do something as pedestrian as grant wishes.

We give you power.

How you use that power...

How that power is shaped...

### Key Scene: Kotori looks on as her house burns

**Caption (Kotori's kitsune)**

That's all up to you.

### Unknown labyrinth

**Kotori, magical girl, attacking**

RAAAAAAAH!!

**Unknown Phantom, hurt**

ZVVVHAA

**Unknown Phantom, attacking**

ZZZH!

**Kotori, magical girl, attacking**

AAAAH!!

**Black kitsune, neutral**

Do you always hang back like this?

**Kotori's kitsune, neutral**

Fighting alongside her, like some partners, could be dangerous.

What are you doing here?

**Black kitsune, neutral**

What no thank you for saving the life of your girl?

**Kotori, magical girl, worn-out**

Ha... haa...

**Unknown phantom, neutral**

Raaah!

**Kotori, magical girl, angry**

I didn't need a break anyway!

**Kotori's kitsune, neutral**

And how exactly did you manage that?

**Black kitsune, neutral**

Just a matter of shifting her desires a bit.

The route she took, it would have made her into a nightmare.

**Kotori's kitsune, neutral**

Isn't all the same to you?

**Black kitsune, neutral**

I can't use nightmares...

#### VFX: Labyrinth disappearing

### Mizuno Ward Park, evening

**Kotori, summer school uniform, worn-out**

Haa... Ha

Where's... the... nightmare?

**Kotori's kitsune, neutral**

It looks like it got away.

#### VFX: Kotori falls

### Black void

***Narration (Kotori's kitsune)***

How you use that power...

That's up to you.

I said that, but ever time she fights herself to the point of exhaustion, whether she finds a nightmare or not, I can't help but feel a little guilty.

What exactly did I do to Miss Kotori Ai?

Was this truly the form her power was meant to take?

What right do we have to even form these contracts?
