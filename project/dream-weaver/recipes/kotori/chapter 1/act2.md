## Scene 

### Key Scene: Kotori stands in front of a mirror as a magical girl

**_Narration (Kotori)_**

The creature explained that I had become a magical girl.

This was no fantasy, no delusion.

This was the power it had spoken of.

### Kotori's bedroom, night/dark

**Kotori, magical girl, neutral**

#### VFX: transformation

**Kotori, pajamas, thinking**

*(What do I do now?)*

**_Narration (Kotori)_**

To be honest the suggestion of getting rid of my step-brother and step-father kept bouncing around menacingly in my head.

I couldn't just do that, could I?

I mean I probably had that power now, but, no matter what they had done to me, it wasn't right to just kill them...

Was it?

**Kotori's kitsune, neutral**

I must tell you this power isn't exactly free.

**Kotori, pajamas, tired**

I'm not surprised.

Can you tell me about it tomorrow?

**Kotori's kitsune, neutral**

There's no pressing reason to tell you now.

Why not rest for the time being?

### Daito Ward Elementary School Classroom, morning

**Generic 5th grade girl, pig-tailed**

A magical girl?

Seriously, she said that?

**Generic, 5th grade girl, side-pony**

Yeah, can you believe it?

Everyone knows magical girls aren't real.

**_Narration (Kotori)_**

That's right, magical girls can't possibly be real.

Just like unicorns aren't real and magic is just illusion.

I didn't really remember much of what happened after my beating last night, but I did remember meeting a creature calling itself a demigod.

Then again demigods couldn't be real either...

### Key Scene: Kotori holds her heart container under her desk

**_Narration (Kotori)_**

There was only one problem.

In my hand, I held proof that the demigod fox was real...

That I was actually a magical girl...

And that what happened last night actually happened.

**Caption (Kotori's Classmate)**

Hey, Kotori-chan, how are you?

**Caption (Kotori)**

*(Oh, just fine, only I'm a magical girl now)*

*(Hey, I heard you were one too.)*

**_Narration (Kotori)_**

I thought about saying something like that.

This was the same classmates the other two girls had been talking about.

Of course I had no proof *she* was a magical girl, and I doubt she saw my heart seed.

I didn't even know if other girls had them.

I hid my seed.

### Daito Elementary School Classroom, morning

**Kotori, casual outfit, smiling**

You know how it is.

**Teacher, off screen**

Okay, everyone, take your seats.

### Saiki Ward Game Center, ext, late afternoon

**Generic 5th grade girl, side-pony**

Are you sure its okay for you to come today?

Your dad seems pretty mad when you come home late.

**Kotori, casual outfit, smiling**

It's fine, my father is with my brother for some school event.

They won't be home until evening.

**_Narration (Kotori)_**

I was so happy when I heard neither of my tormentors would be home until evening that I didn't even bother to find out why.

**Generic 5th grade girl, long-hair**

You're sure? What about you mom?

**Kotori, causal outfit, smiling**

It's really fine, I just texted her.

She's fine with me being out with friends as long as I'm not home too late.

**Generic 5th grade girl, side-pony**

This place is really far from Daito Ward, huh?

**Generic 5th grade girl, long-hair**

It's just one ward over, but, yeah, its still pretty far.

Was this your first train ride?

**Kotori, casual outfit, smiling**

I've been on the train lots of times, but not to Saiki Ward.

**Generic 5th grade girl, side-pony**

I've never been.

My mom usually drives when we have to go somewhere far.

**Generic 5th grade girl, long-hair**

Must be nice to have parents that can afford a car.

#### VFX: Flash

**_Narration (Kotori)_**

As the other girls continued talking about Saiki Ward and the Game Center we supposed to be entering, I felt something strange.

Come to think of it, I never asked the demigod fox that gave me my power what kind of payment it expected of me, or what I could really do.

Before long, it seemed I had somehow become separated from my friends.

*-ring- -ring-*

### Saiki Ward Game Center, ext., dark

**Kotori, casual outfit, worried**

My phone?

### White void

**Kotori's mother, off screen, electronic text**

Kotori, I'm sorry, but your dad came home early.

He wants to know where you are.

**Kotori's step-father, off screen, electronic text**

Kotori! Where are you!?

### Saiki Ward Game Center, ext., dark

**Kotori, casual outfit, terrified**

*(I thought everything would be okay...)*

Hey, where'd everyone go!?

### Key Scene: Kotori stands in the middle of a street in Saiki Ward, there is not a single other soul around her

**Caption (Kotori's Kistune)**

There is something not right here.

**Caption (Kotori)**

It's you!

There should be tons of people here, but everyone is just gone...

### City Labyrinth, ext.

**Kotori's kitsune, neutral**

I suppose I should explain a few things.

**Kotori, casual outfit, surprised**

What's happening?

Where'd the Game Center go?

**Kotori's kitsune, neutral**

As a magical girl, in exchange for granting you the power you seek, you are duty-bound to fight nightmares.

Nightmares create fortresses within special dimensions we call labyrinths.

Right now we're in a labyrinth.

**Kotori, casual outfit, neutral**

Okay, so one of those nightmares is nearby?

All I have to do is beat it right?

What does it look like?

**Kotori's kitsune, neutral**

Well, first, you should probably transform.

As for what the nightmare looks like, well that varies, but magical girls can sense them, so they always seem to know one when they see one.

**Kotori, magical girl, determined**

So I just have to follow my gut and find it, right?

That doesn't seem hard.

**Kotori's kitsune, neutral**

Well, nightmares do tend to gather lost souls, people who no longer feel they have a place in society, called phantoms.

**City phantom, angry**

Vvvvhhhaa!

**Kotori's kitsune, neutral**

Speak of the devil!

These things will try and stop you.

**Kotori, magical girl, attacking**

Hiiiyaa!

**City phantom, hurt**

Aarrgh?

**Kotori, magical girl, angry**

Let 'em try!

**Kotori's kitsune, neutral**

Don't get too cocky!

Remember, you just became a magical girl last night!

**Kotori, magical girl, attacking**

Why does that matter!?

**City phantom, hurt**

AArrrgh!

**Kotori, magical girl, haughty**

Haha ha!

These things are weak!

**Kotori's kitsune, neutral**

Seriously, not all phantoms are weak!

Be careful!

#### VFX: Kotori senses something

**Kotori, magical girl, determined**

The nightmare!

**Kotori's mistune, neutral**

Watch out!

**City nightmare, attacking**

ZZAAAgh!

**Kotori, magical girl, hurt**

AAAH!!

O-ouch!

**Kotori's kitsune, neutral**

I don't know if you can handle a nightmare just yet!

**Kotori, magical girl, tired**

*-huff- -wheeze-*

I-I'm a m-magical girl!

It's my job to beat these, right?

**Kotori's kitsune, neutral**

There are other girls!

**Choice, eos**

1. Keep fighting (bad ending)
2. Retreat for now (continue to next episode)
