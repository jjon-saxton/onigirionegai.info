          <p>The following scene was written and designed as a proof-of-concept to test the possibility of using modern web technologies to create a visual-novel style dialog. It depicts a meeting between Yui Sakano and a new creature. Though certain specifics will undoubtedly change, the story of this scene will likely become cannon. Therefore, a <span class="text-danger">spoiler warning</span> is in effect beyond this point!</p>
