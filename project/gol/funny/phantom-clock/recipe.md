Scene

K, so I was all snuggly in my bed, the sounds of rain playing in my speaker, sending me off to sleep...
Suddenly! An alarm goes off somewhere in the house
I wake up, afraid it might be a fire alarm, but I quickly realize it isn’t the right sound
Which is good, but the alarm is annoying, and it won’t stop
I hear my cat, so I go out into the living room. The two of us search high and low for the source of the alarm
Finally, on the couch, there is an old-style alarm clock. I search for away to turn off the alarm. I hit something and the alarm shuts up \n.n/
Ten minutes later though, it goes off again :surprised: I had only found the snooze button!
My cat and I search again for the alarm, only, it isn’t where we found it the first time, this time it is on the TV stand!
Thinking nothing of this, perhaps maybe I had set it there after all, I found the alarm off switch and was finally able to sleep.
But, when I woke up this morning, the alarm clock wasn’t there! Dun dun duuun
The end, :laughing:
