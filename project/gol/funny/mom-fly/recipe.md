**Inquisitive Normal Yaya**

So, there are a ton of things people find annoying right?

There are two things I think *everyone* can agree on:

1. Flies! Am I right!? Flies are suuuuper annoying aren't they?
2. Parents, especially moms!

**Apologitactic Normal Yaya**

Sorry for all you moms out there, but you were young once and you probably thought the same thing.

**Neutral Normal Yaya**

So here's a fun thing, what if your mom, was a fly?

**Laughing Normal Yaya**

Pretty silly, huh? I mean it obviously couldn't really happen. If your mom was a fly, you'd be a fly too, right?

**Serious Normal Yaya**

You're not a fly are you?

I mean how would you be reading this if you were a fly?

**Smiling Normal Yaya**

Anyway, apparently my brain didn't get the memo and decided to cast my mom as a fly in a very wierd dream.

Soooo, there I was sitting in front of an old computer, don't ask!

**Normal Yaya Shaking her Head**

I mean this computer was like from the 1980's or something, green text on a dark green background, all that fun stuff. The only reason I could think of for a computer like that being here was the fact that I've been watching videos on old Apple computers, mostly Macs, but whatever.

**Sweat dropping Normal Yaya**

I'm sitting in front of this computer and I find this wierd Disk. Yeah, all sorts of old stuff going on here!

**Serious Normal Yaya**

So this disk had a label on it that told you how to load it and like a couple of programs that were on it.

I stuck the disk in a drive on the side of the computer and began typing the command to load programs from it.

This being a dream, I couldn't actually read anything, but I must've noticed something wierd about one of the program names. Anyway, I typed that name in and hit the 'enter' key all dramatic like, like how you see 'em do it in the movies.

**Special: Screen showing 'text' and a bar circling**

Something was displayed on the screen behind one of those bars that go -\|/- or something like that.

Suddenly I seemed to be just a little smaller. Like pretty small, I could feel myself now standing on the keyboard, but I not like just on a key, that'll be important, trust me.

**Special: Cat paw**

So I lift up my hand to my face....only it wasn't a hand anymore....it was a cat's paw!

**Laughing Normal Yaya**

Of course, I did what anyone would do in this situation, I started licking my paw.

So, now I'm cat, nothing wrong with that. Well, I don't think so anyway...

**Sweat-dropping Normal Yaya**

But everyone else seems to think there's a problem.

**Serious Normal Yaya**

So we, er, well, they, decide to find a way to change me back to a human.

Particularly worried was my mom, who frantically starts trying to figure out how to load that weird program back off the disk, and change me back!

**Special: Screen showing 'text' and a bar circling**

Fortunately mom is finally able to load the program and...well...let's just say things don't quite work out the way she hoped.

**Special: Yaya's Hand**

Sure I was human again, which was great, I guess, but, well....

**Sweat dropping Yaya**

Let's just say mom was a different story.
